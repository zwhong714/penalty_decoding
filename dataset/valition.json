Others are keeping a close eye on the still evolving legal, regulatory and political environment.\n\nVoters in California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada voted Nov. 8 to approve the use of recreational marijuana, joining Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska, where it had previously been legalized. (A recount of Maine's close result is scheduled.) More than two dozen states have medical marijuana programs.\n\nBut the drug is still against federal law.\n\nA closer look at what it all means for workers and businesses:\n\nCAN MY EMPLOYER STILL TEST ME FOR POT?\n\nBottom line: You can't come to work high. You can still be drug tested. And you can still be fired \u2014 or not hired \u2014 for failing a drug test even if you're not the least bit impaired at work.\n\nAll the states with legalized recreational pot have exemptions for workplace drug policies.\n\nIn Massachusetts, for example, the law includes language stating that \"the authority of employers to enact and enforce workplace policies restricting the consumption of marijuana by employees\" is not changed.\n\n\"Yes, you may be able to have (marijuana) at home, but that doesn't mean it's OK in the workplace,\" said Edward Yost, an HR specialist with the Society for Human Resources Management.\n\nWHAT ABOUT WORKPLACE SAFETY?\n\nAdvocates for marijuana legalization said it was never their intention to compromise safety, a central reason offered by employers for drug testing.\n\n\"We don't want anyone to come to work impaired on any drugs,\" said David Boyer, campaign manager for the ballot initiative in Maine.\n\nA 2013 survey by the employee screening firm HireRight found 78 percent of employers conducted drug tests either randomly, as a condition of employment, after accidents or for some combination of those reasons.\n\nThe federal government requires drug testing for some workers, including truck drivers and others in transportation.\n\nQuest Diagnostics, which performed nearly 11 million laboratory-based drug tests for employers in 2015, said the percentage of tests coming back positive has shown a modest increase in recent years. Nearly half of all positive tests showed evidence of marijuana use.\n\nCAN I GET FIRED EVEN IF I'M NOT HIGH?\n\nTHC, the psychoactive chemical in cannabis, can stay in a person's system for days or even weeks, experts say \u2014 long after the buzz has subsided.\n\n\"It's the equivalent of firing somebody who drank a glass of wine on Friday evening and then came to work on Monday,\" said Tamar Todd, legal director for the Drug Policy Alliance, who believes employers should reconsider zero-tolerance policies in light of changing laws and attitudes.\n\nA number of efforts are underway to develop an accurate method, akin to the Breathalyzer for alcohol, to measure actual marijuana impairment. Such a test might be useful not only for employers, but also for police and prosecutors trying to determine what constitutes driving under the influence of marijuana in states where recreational pot is legal.\n\nWHAT SHOULD COMPANIES DO?\n\nAt a minimum, companies should review their current polices, make sure their managers are trained and make clear to employees that marijuana use on or off the job can still land them in trouble, said James Reidy, a New Hampshire-based attorney who advises clients around the country on drug testing issues.\n\nTina Sharby, chief human resources officer for an Easter Seals affiliate with about 1,700 employees in New England, said the organization, which provides services for people with special needs, is monitoring the evolving legal and regulatory environment but is sticking with its drug testing protocols for now.\n\n\"We have a drug-free workplace policy, and we believe that the current policy we have is effective,\" Sharby said.\n\nBut drug testing and zero-tolerance rules can make it difficult for businesses with a need to recruit young professionals who may harbor more liberal attitudes toward pot.\n\n\"We have ski industries out here, and if they really took a hard line on marijuana use, they would have to shut down,\" said Curtis Graves, information resource manager for the Colorado-based Mountain States Employers Council.\n\nAfter Colorado became the first state to legalize recreational marijuana in 2012, surveys showed an uptick in workplace drug testing, Graves said, but that trend has begun to shift in the other direction.\n\n\"Employers who have a zero-tolerance policy maybe shouldn't apply that to non-safety sensitive workers, because if they do testing on them, they run the risk of inviting an invasion of privacy claim,\" suggested Amanda Baer, a Boston-area attorney who specializes in labor and employment issues.\n\nWHAT DO"}

Read Part 1 and Part 2, which were written in response to statements made by former UIDAI head Nandan Nilekani.\n\n*\n\nThe Government of India has argued in the Supreme Court and in Parliament that its primary purpose in promoting Aadhaar is to improve the efficiency of social schemes, and that the use of Aadhaar has generated huge savings since 2014.\n\nThe UIDAI (in a statement), its CEO Dr ABP Pandey (in a column) and the Attorney General of India (in the Supreme Court) have claimed that use of Aadhaar since 2014 has generated huge savings. This claim has even been repeated frequently by Nandan Nilekani (here, here and here). Of this figure, \u20b926,408 crore (over half) is attributed (Rajya Sabha Starred Question 384, dated 07.04.17) to savings from the PAHAL (Pratyaksh Hanstantrit Labh) scheme.\n\nUnderstanding the PAHAL Scheme\n\nMost of the LPG cylinders sold to households by the Oil Marketing companies (OMCs), like BPCL, IOCL and HPCL, has an inherent subsidy component built into it.\n\nEvery household is currently entitled to purchase up to 12 subsidised LPG cylinders a year, which are sold at a price fixed by the government. Under the PAHAL scheme (also known as the Direct Benefit Transfer or DBT), this subsidy is no longer included in the price of a cylinder, but is instead provided to the consumer by bank transfer, with the consumer then paying the full cylinder price.\n\nInitially every LPG connection was required to seed the bank account number of the connection holder to enable direct transfer of the subsidy. It was then determined that the best way to identify multiple connections with the same holder is to link the UID of the holder to the LPG connection.\n\nSince UID is almost always unique for an individual, it was assumed that the linking will eliminate multiple connections and will reduce demand for subsidised cylinders which in turn will result in the subsidy outflow. This reduction in subsidy outflow is referred to as savings from UID on the LPG scheme.\n\nUnderstanding the impact of the UID on the PAHAL scheme\n\nAn audit of the savings claim for the entire PAHAL scheme done by CAG for the period April \u2014 December 2015, points out that most of the savings (92%) is because of the fall in LPG price in the international market, and only 8% (\u20b91764 Crore) can be attributed to various initiatives (UID being just one among them) that reduced demand for subsidised cylinders. An IISD study however estimated the savings generated only by using UID is even lower (\u20b9120 Crore) during this period.\n\nIt is possible to understand the impact of the UID on the PAHAL scheme, and compute an updated savings figure, by using publicly available data from the Government of India.\n\n1. How much savings does Government of India claim Aadhaar has enabled in LPG subsidy?\n\nSince 2015, the Government Of India has produced several different claims for the amount saved through the use of Aadhaar in PAHAL. The most recent (RS Starred Question 384, on 07.04.17) \u20b926,408 crore savings claim is composed of three separate figures:\n\n\n2. How is the above figure calculated?\n\nGovernment Of India has provided supporting calculations for \u20b914672 Crores and \u20b96912 Crores, but has not provided any for the FY 2017 figure of \u20b94284 Crores.\n\nThe calculations for FY 2014-15 and FY 2015-16 are provided below:\n\nHence the formula adopted for calculating savings is as follows:\n\nSavings = Blocked connections x Duration x Subsidised Cylinders x Subsidy per Cylinder\n\n3. Why the above figure is inaccurate\n\nEvery single one of the data points used in the above calculation is inaccurate as explained below:\n\nBlocked Connections\n\nAll inactive connections have been inaccurately classified as having been active connections illegally drawing subsidised LPG prior to the launch of PAHAL, when Government Of India's own figures show that 1.02 Crore (in 2012) had been inactive for years and the majority of the remainder were inactive for reasons unconnected to PAHAL or Aadhaar. This is also reiterated by CAG report(on page 46)\n\nHence the government's estimate of connections blocked because of UID is much lower than they have claimed, since they attributed inactive connections and blocked connections through other means from 2012 as blocked by UID.\n\nDuration\n\nThe calculations then assume that this incorrect figure for blocked connections applied to the whole year, when in FY"}

Others, like the alligator, may not age at all. So what do they have in common? They're evidence that aging may not be an inherent trait, but a product of how species evolve in given environments\u2014and that evolution may actually be programming species, including humans, to die.\n\nThe tantalizing prospect is the subject of a new study, \"Programmed death is favored by natural selection in spatial systems,\" from some top flight complex systems researchers and biologists. They've used a brand new mathematical model to flip the traditional understanding of the aging process nearly on its head. If its results prove accurate, it would have massive ramifications for how we understand the process of aging itself\u2014and may lend hope to those seeking to reprogram humans to live even longer.\n\nThe bound-to-be controversial idea is being put forward by Yaneer Bar-Yam, the head of the New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI), Donald E. Ingber, the founding director of the Harvard Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering, and Justin Werfel, a researcher affiliated with both. The team's new work has been published in the Physical Review of Letters, and it argues that the \"mathematics underpinning our understanding of evolution is fundamentally flawed.\"\n\nRight now, we assume that evolution is naturally selecting for organisms with longer lifespans\u2014giving them a better chance to survive, right?\n\n\"In traditional theory, evolution will always choose the longest lifespan, and then what we experience is the longest possible, biologically,\" Bar-Yam told me in a recent interview. \"We can shorten it, we cannot lengthen it.\"\n\nBut what if creatures' lifespans\u2014including humans'\u2014weren't necessarily determined by their bodies' adeptness at staying alive, but regulated by evolution, based on the amount of resources available to a given population, and its members' pressures to reproduce? What if death wasn't a foregone conclusion, but rather a sort of measure instituted to ensure a single generation wouldn't suck down all the resources and doom the next? That's the team's findings, stated very basically.\n\n\"If evolution is determining the lifespan that we have, then we can choose to change that, by intervening in the mechanism that is being used to control our lifespans,\" Bar-Yam said. His works cites the host of creatures whose bodies behave starkly against their own self interest as evidence that death is evolutionary regulated, not inherent.\n\n\"Aging is not inherent. It's genetic. The prospect of extending lifespans dramatically is a reasonable conclusion.\"\n\n\"For example, there's an octopus that lives until it reproduces then it dies,\" he tells me. \"But if you remove its gland it will continue to live, and that death is being triggered by the system as opposed to an inherent breakdown.\"\n\n\"Crocodiles,\" he continues. \"As far as we know, they don't age. There are animals that have wildly varying lifespans in relation to each other. Rockfish\u2014some of them live a few years, and some of them live hundreds of years.\" Bar-Yam sent me a graph of the different Rockfish species, and they live for radically different lifespans, despite remarkable genetic similarities.\n\nRockfish lifespans. Cailliet et al, Experimental Gerontology, 36, 739 (2001)\n\n\nAll this, he says, is evidence that aging is not inherent, but a baked-in evolutionary tic.\n\nSo how did the researchers get there? Why had the previous mathematical model used to describe evolution come to such a radically different conclusion?\n\n\"That traditional evolutionary theory works with an assumption where every organism is in the same environment,\" Bar-Yam said. \"You can call it an averaging approximation. In physics, it's called the 'mean field approximation,' and it basically ignores the local context. One of the core things that we've done is point out that when local context is included in the theory, what you end up having is a feedback property between the organism and the environment, and the organism's properties change the environment, and that changes the outcome.\"\n\nTeam Harvard + NECSI employed a new, and, they believe, more accurate model for how organisms interact with the local resources they depend upon for survival, over time.\n\nThe result is fascinating: \"We find that spatial heterogeneity of limiting resources and self-organizing population structures result in robust selection for lifespan limitation,\" they write in the paper. In other words: combine limited resources and fierce competition in a given region with a population fighting for survival, and it results in shorter lifespans. \"In our model, intrinsic mortality leaves resources for descendants, which are more likely to be found in the"}

On Tuesday, Trump said he did not fear a trade war with Canada, a day after his administration moved to impose tariffs on Canadian lumber.\n\nIn Mexico City, Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said Pena Nieto had called Trump on Wednesday and spoken with him for about 20 minutes in a conversation focused exclusively on the looming talks over NAFTA's \"renegotiation and modernization.\"\n\nTrump has accused Mexico of luring away American factories and jobs with cheap labor and other advantages enabled by NAFTA.

MHRA will now work with individual companies and trade bodies in relation to making sure products containing CBD, used for a medical purpose, which can be classified as medicines, satisfy the legal requirements of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012.\n\nThis rational approach stands in sharp and tragic contrast to draconian drug laws in the U.S., where, as of January 13, CBD oil \u2014 which does not contain the psychoactive chemical THC, which gives people a high \u2014 and all cannabinoids will be considered dangerous substances.\n\nHealthcare and cannabis rights advocates have excoriated the DEA's brash and baseless move, noting lives will now be in jeopardy.\n\n\"The whole policy around this plant is just so illogical,\" Robert J. Capecchi, director of federal policies at the Marijuana Policy Project, told Vice. \"Even when you look at the criteria you're supposed to be looking at under the law, they're just not following it. It's just a stupid policy for lack of a better term.\"\n\nTHC-containing cannabis \u2014 also medically beneficial for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, among many other conditions \u2014 still remains as a Schedule I substance in the U.S., and is not considered medicine in Britain.\n\nBut the latter has taken steps in the right direction with the new classification for CBD \u2014 a complete reversal of cease and desist orders sent by MHRA to vendors only months ago, as High Times notes, ordering it to be \"removed from sale in the UK.\"\n\n\"The change really came about with us offering an opinion that CBD is in fact a medicine,\" Gerald Heddel, director of inspection and enforcement at the agency, explained to Sky News, \"and that opinion was based on the fact that we noted that people were making some quite stark claims about serious diseases that could be treated with CBD.\"\n\nDecades of government propaganda about the putative dangers of 'marijuana' \u2014 amplified exponentially by President Nixon's administration's agenda to, in essence, criminalize black people and the anti-war left \u2014 still linger in the stigmatization of all the cannabis plant's myriad derivatives.\n\nDespite the DEA's war on cannabis and its users, onerous prohibition has been voted out in an increasing number of states \u2014 forcing those who need it to uproot their lives and move, in order not to face arrest over their medicine. Medical research into cannabis and cannabinoids continues to evince the miraculous assets the plant offers. In just one example, as High Times explains,\n\nIn early December, researchers from the University of Alabama found that CBD oil reduces both the frequency and severity of seizures in children and adults with with severe, intractable epilepsy. In two-thirds of the 81 participants, the severity was reduced by at least 50 percent.\n\nIn classifying CBD as medicine, MHRA recognizes such benefits \u2014 and the improved health of British citizens \u2014 eclipse the value in blindly continuing dangerous and inaccurate propaganda.\n\nSadly, the highly profitable war on drugs and influence of pharmaceutical corporations have the DEA feigning ignorance about cannabis and CBD \u2014 at the expense of people's lives.\n\nClaire Bernish writes for TheFreeThoughtProject.com, where this article first appeared."}

They sought a return to the glory days of communism and the elimination of corporate and capitalist influence, particularly in orbital facilities and offworld colonies throughout the Sol system. This culminated in the Interplanetary War, which resulted in the faction's eventual defeat by the newly-formed United Nations Space Command.[1]\n\nOrganizational history [ edit ]\n\nAs multinational entities like the United Nations spread capitalism across newly-colonized territories in the Solar System, the mid-2100's saw a rebirth of communism with largely the same goals as its old nineteenth and twentieth-century advocates. The Koslovics, a revolutionary group of rebels began orchestrating attacks against their opponents on the far-right, the Jovian-based fascist Frieden, followed by a bloody struggle in South America during the Rain Forest Wars, and ending with a last stand on Mars during the Argyre Planitia Campaign where UNSC infantry spearheaded a decisive, fatal blow to their encampments. Subsequently, the remaining Koslovic forces throughout the system were systematically destroyed by the UNSC during the Interplanetary War between 2164 and 2170,[1] and they formally surrendered to the UNSC in 2170 with the Callisto Treaty.\n\nList of appearances [ edit ]"}

Bonnie was portrayed as a young blonde woman in a gold blouse and short blue lederhosen, wearing a baseball cap and frequently carrying a blue-and-gold broom which she would use to sweep the bases. The first Bonnie in 1973 was Donna Bozmoski, a sophomore at Brookfield East High School, Brookfield, Wisconsin.\n\nBonnie was first introduced as the female companion to the Brewers' mascot Bernie Brewer. Bernie and Bonnie were created by then-team vice president Dick Hackett as part of an effort to create a lively atmosphere at County Stadium, which also included hiring organist Frank Charles to play a Wurlitzer during the games. As Hackett remembers it, Bernie and Bonnie were added over the objections of team owner Bud Selig.\n\nBonnie was noted mainly for her colorful antics during the seventh-inning stretch. As the grounds crew swept the infield, Bonnie wielded her signature broom, sweeping off each base in turn. After sweeping third base, she would playfully swat the opposing team's third-base coach on the backside with her broom, following it up with a kiss on his cheek.\n\nBonnie was discontinued after the 1979 season, although no clear reason has ever been given for her \"firing\". Bernie Brewer was discontinued as a mascot in 1984, although he was brought back as a costumed mascot in 1993, complete with full-body costume and large foam head.

But then a friend sent her an email with congratulations and an order: \"Dance your Ph.D.!\"\n\nThe friend was referring to Science's annual contest, which challenges scientists to explain their research through interpretive dance. But Metz only had 3 weeks to go before the deadline. \"Everything had to go fast,\" she says, so she recruited a small army of friends to help her create a dance video that combines hip hop, salsa, and even acro-yoga. Each dance style represented a different interest group that shapes the evolution of policies around water resources.\n\nHer quick thinking paid off: Metz has bested 31 other teams to become this year's Dance Your Ph.D. winner. The judges gave her top marks not only for the work's scientific and artistic merit but how she creatively combined both. She takes home $1000 and a trip to Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, in the spring\u2014thanks to HighWire Press, Science's online publishing platform\u2014where she'll screen her dance video and give a talk. It is the first time a social scientist has scooped the top prize in the contest's 8-year history.\n\nThis year's crop of dances was unusually strong in traditional choreographic technique. Besides the overall prize, there are $500 prizes for four categories: biology, chemistry, physics, and social science, the last of which Metz won. Like Metz, the winners of the other three prizes all have dance training of one kind or another and used it. For biology, Pearl Lee brought her ballet skills to bear on her Ph.D. research on tropoelastin\u2014the precursor protein that builds connective tissue\u2014at the University of Sydney in Australia. For the winner of the physics prize, Merritt Moore, a Ph.D. student at the University of Oxford, in the United Kingdom, it was tango, which she used to explain her research on entangled photons. (Get it?)\n\nPerhaps the most elaborate of the dances, certainly in terms of costumes, came from the chemistry winner Jyaysi Desai, a Ph.D. student at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in Germany. She used dance elements from Bollywood to capture her research on the molecular nets of DNA and protein that white blood cells cast into infection sites to trap bacteria. She won the Audience Favorite award by a landslide.\n\n\"My main aim with this video was to make people laugh,\" Metz says.

But even if Obama's senior advisers didn't make those remarks, as White House officials insist, or even if the officials quoted by Jeffrey Goldberg in The Atlantic spoke without authorization, their words faithfully represent the Oval Office's attitude toward Netanyahu.\n\nThe expressions used by those U.S. officials to refer to the prime minister also recall harsh things that a long line of American presidents and cabinet members have said about Netanyahu over the past 20 years.\n\nIn an article a few years ago, senior U.S. diplomat Aaron David Miller mentioned that Secretary of State James Baker had boycotted Netanyahu when the latter was deputy foreign minister and temporarily banned him from the State Department. And President Bill Clinton walked out furious from his first meeting with Netanyahu in 1996, wondering if the Israeli prime minister thought his country was the superpower.\n\nKeep updated: Sign up to our newsletter Email * Please enter a valid email address Sign up Please wait\u2026 Thank you for signing up.

The same Jeffrey Goldberg reported four years ago that then-Defense Secretary Robert Gates told Obama that Netanyahu was an ungrateful ally and that his policy on the Palestinian issue threatened Israel's future.\n\nThe U.S. officials behind the current attack were apparently trying to influence Israeli public opinion by revealing what the administration really thinks of Netanyahu; to signal to Israelis that their prime minister is seriously damaging strategic relations with the United States and endangering their national security.\n\nBut the insults and coarse language will produce the opposite, at least in the near term. Netanyahu, who believes he's already in an election campaign, took advantage of this incident to portray himself to Israelis as an innocent victim; someone being attacked simply because he's fighting to defend Israel's security interests and the Jewish people's holy places in Jerusalem.\n\nBeyond the release of steam and expression of frustrations the White House has accumulated about Netanyahu over the past five years, the latest attack is a harbinger of how Washington will conduct policy toward the Netanyahu government after next week's congressional elections, during Obama's last two years office. The close security and intelligence cooperation will continue, but America's diplomatic defense of Israel at the United Nations and other international forums will not be immediate and obvious.\n\nIn the face of the diplomatic attack Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas plans to launch against Israel at the United Nations, the Americans will suffice with casting their veto in the Security Council. But regarding anything else, they'll let Abbas run amok as he pleases.\n\nIt will be the same regarding European initiatives for sanctions against the settlements.

It found that participants who regularly engaged in word puzzles like crosswords had brain function 10 years younger than their calendar age. They were tested for attention, short-term memory accuracy, grammatical reasoning and speed.\n\nWATCH BELOW: New way to detect Alzheimer's disease\n\n\"Our study suggests that the frequency of use of word puzzles is related to superior cognitive function on a range of different tests, even after controlling for age, education and gender,\" Keith Wesnes, lead author of the study and professor of cognitive neuroscience at the University of Exeter, said to Global News.\n\n\"One likely explanation is that when engaging in such tasks, the brain has increased blood flow to certain areas, which could have beneficial effects on brain structure and integrity. The concept of 'use it or lose it' could well apply here.\"\n\nAlthough the study has not evaluated whether it makes a difference when people take up word puzzles \u2014 if they've been doing them all their lives versus starting them in later years \u2014 it did find that those who engaged in them more frequently performed better on the evaluating tasks. Wesnes says similar findings were seen in those who engaged in number puzzles, like Sudoku.\n\nThis study could \"cast doubt\" on the negative responses to brain training games like Lumosity, Wesnes says.\n\nIn January 2016, Aditi Jhaveri, a consumer education specialist with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection, published a blog post widely debunking Lumosity's \"proven neuroscience research\" that claims to prevent age-related memory decline.\n\n\"The FTC charged that there isn't solid science showing that Lumosity's 'brain training' games work the way they say they would,\" she wrote. \"Playing Lumosity's games might make you better at those games, the FTC says, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will sharpen your memory or brain power in the real world.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Your trouble with sleeping may put you at risk for Alzheimer's disease later in life\n\nWesnes says that they will be conducting a trial where participants will engage in games like those offered by Lumosity to assess whether their cognitive function improves.\n\n\"If that occurred, it would clearly debunk [the FTC's claims],\" he said.\n\nAccording to the Alzheimer Society of Canada, there are 564,000 Canadians living with dementia and that number will skyrocket to 937,000 in 15 years. The annual cost to the country is $10.4 billion.\n\nIn addition to word and number puzzles, exercise and diet have been shown to delay the onset of cognitive decline in old age."}

Are you afraid that, as you get older, you're falling short of your goals of being all of the above? There's a tendency for people to believe the old adage of the famous psychologist William James who asserted that personality is set in plaster by the age of 30. Or you might be lured into agreeing with the perspective that our personalities are through changing by the age of 5 (or perhaps 12). Either way, you might feel discouraged and hopeless about never being the kind of person you always imagined you could be.\n\nFrom another point of view, however, the to change your personality could be the very inspiration you need to set the wheels in motion. The most difficult step in the process of changing your personality is recognizing that such change will make you happier. Having made that decision, you could theoretically embark on a program of structured activities that would lead you to where you want to be in those desired traits. The only thing holding you back, at that point, is the conviction that no one's personality can ever really change.\n\nConsider the April 2016 episode involving during his run for the Republican nomination for U.S. President. After winning the New York State primary, Trump's advisors declared that Trump would now settle down into a more \"Presidential personality.\" He was going to become kinder, gentler, and more considered in his thinking, comments, and general demeanor. This announcement led to considerable skepticism among political analysts, who themselves were of the belief that personality is basically immutable. Trump might seem, on the outside, to be softer and more thoughtful, they argued, but his aggressive and combative style could never change. In fact, Trump's decision to change lasted only a day or two. Before long, he was announcing that if he'd projected a more Presidential image, he wouldn't have gotten as far as he had. Trump's lack of willingness or ability to transform only confirmed the popular belief that no one can ever really change, even if they believed, as in Trump's case for a short time, that it was to their advantage to do so.\n\nReinforcing that view of personality as stable is the general gist not only of James, Freud, and Trump, but of one of the most well-known theories in the field of personality at the moment. According to the Five Factor Model, as originally conceptualized, you are high or low virtually at birth on a set of five basic traits which each have six sub-traits or facets. Part of your psychological constitution, just like your eye color, are your standings on these 30 qualities. A kid? You're bound to be an introverted adult. Never made your bed despite your mom's constant reminders? Then you're low on conscientious for sure, and will always be doomed to live a sloppy life.\n\nFortunately, the view that personality is unchangeable is changing. We know from considerable research on conducted based on the Five Factor Model (Terracciano et al., 2005) that some personality traits, and facets of those traits, modulate over time. Part of the reason for this, when these changes occur in later life, is that some of the high scorers on less desirable or healthy traits are no longer in the population to be measured in their later years. The risky ones die because of their high- behaviors, those low on die because of their unhealthy habits, and people high on may be gone from the population because they engaged in heavy use of and . Those left standing in later adulthood are the conscientious, the agreeable, and the emotionally stable. On the Five Factor trait of openness to experience, the ones who are high in this quality may live longer because they maintain a more intellectually engaging lifestyle. Extroverts may have an advantage in living longer because their outgoing behavior garners more support from family and friends in their networks.\n\nWith that said, what if you would like actually to change now so that you can be one of those from an early demise at the end of your life? In all probability, one of the traits you might like to change about yourself the most is how introverted or extroverted you are. In a society that values extroverts, being able to easily and often would seem like a desirable trait to have. Whether or not this is true is another matter, but if you feel your inner extrovert needs to balance your outer introvert, it may seem like a desirable step to take.\n\nThe theory that is possible, and achievable, was put to the test in a pair of experiments conducted by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign psychologists Nathan Hudson and Christopher Fraley (2015). Undergraduates taking a personality psychology course participated in 16-week intensive intervention in which they were coached in making the changes they desired in their personalities on the Five Factor traits. At the start of the intervention, the students indicated that"}

There are four quick and easy ways to spot if a Nintendo DS cartridge is a bootleg. If suspicious, check multiple items \u2013 not all bootlegs will have the same flaws.\n\n#1 \u2013 Cartridge won't boot in a Nintendo DSi unit:\n\nAs the newest version of the DS system on the market, the Nintendo DSi includes a newer version of the operating system from the manufacturer that does a better job at detecting bootleg software and rejecting it with an error message. After launching the game, you'll see the message below displayed on the bottom screen.\n\nNon-booting DS screen\n\n\nPower down the system, remove the cartridge and re-insert it. Power the system back on and try to launch the game. If you receive this error again, it's very likely you have a bootleg game.\n\n\n#2 \u2013 Cartridge Construction is of low quality:\n\nTwo things you can quickly check without having a Nintendo DSi handy is the quality of the cartridge's construction. First, with any Nintendo DS cartridge you'll notice a seam down the middle of the side. If you tug on this with a fingernail, the cartridge should not separate at all. If it does, you've got a bootleg.\n\nBack of cartridge\n\n\nSecond, look at the back of the cartridge. Here, you see a bootleg cartridge on the left and a real cartridge on the right. Inside the Nintendo Racetrack logo, you'll notice that outlined in blue, the real cartridge has the registered trademark logo \u00ae after the word \"Nintendo\". This is missing from the bootleg. Also, above the gold contact points, there are white letters and numbers. While the letters in this picture say \"Nintendo\", not all cartridges will \u2013 but all legitimate cartridges will have white letters above these gold contact points.\n\n\n#3 - Matching the Serial Numbers:\n\nEach published title has a serial number unique to itself. This serial number can be found on the front of the cartridge and on the back of the game case, next to the UPC. On the cartridge, you''ll find the serial number in the format of NTR-XXXX-YYY, where XXXX is the unique serial number for that game, and YYY represents the region, such as USA.\n\nSerial numbers\n\n\nOn the back of the game case, you''ll find the serial number again, in the format of NTR-P-XXXX, again where XXXX is the unique serial number. These two serial numbers will always match on a legitimate copy of the game. Also, compare this serial number to the string of letters printed in black on the back of the cartridge. The first four letters on the back will always match this serial number as well.\n\n\n#4 \u2013 The Case of the Odd Case:\n\nThere are three types of DS Game Cases. The standard US case is black and has a slot for holding Game Boy Advance games that is solid. Newer \"eco-friendly\" DS cases have no GBA slot and feature a cut-out recycling symbol behind the manual. The Japanese case is black and has a slot for holding Game Boy Advance games that is in three pieces. The European case is clear and thicker, to accommodate game manuals in multiple languages. Games sold in the US are NEVER sold in the European style cases and rarely ever sold in the Japanese style cases.

The signature for Jack One on the original deed (left) and on the deed transfer (right) are significantly different.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe same day Jack One handed over ownership of the condo, Tina filed a quitclaim deed, transferring her share over to Jack Two, who then took out a mortgage. One source says the loan was for approximately $140,000, while the other source, who didn't dispute any other details of the transfer, says it was for $165,000.\n\nBoth sources say that Jack One didn't realize he didn't own his condo until nearly a month later. On Nov. 10, 2004, he attempted to sell the condo to a new couple, and \"it became apparent that there was this lien on [Jack One's] property,\" said one source, who believes Jack One paid off the loan \"because he didn't want his son to go to jail.\"\n\nOur sources claim that Jack Two was able to defraud his father (and son) without much effort because they all have the same full name\u2014John Joseph-Louis Johnson\u2014and because Tina had a real estate license and knew her way around the documents. (On June 5, 2007, the Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Growth immediately revoked Tina's license for an unspecified rule violation and fined her $10,000.) When Jack One discovered he was being defrauded, one source says, he would settle the debt before the authorities got involved.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJack One was reportedly furious when, under pressure from his parents, Jack Three fired agent Pat Brisson and signed over control of his finances. According to a source, he knew they would handle his grandson's money the same way they handled his. \"Jack knew the history he had with them, that he couldn't have them be in control of the money, and that's exactly what happened,\" the source said.\n\nMultiple phone calls to Tina Johnson requesting comment from her and Jack Two were not returned. An email to Tina bounced back as undeliverable, indicating that she deleted the account since we contacted her for our previous report. A spokesperson for the Blue Jackets said Jack Johnson is not speaking about his financial situation.\n\nBelow are the documents for the Las Vegas condo. The first is Jack One's original deed; the second and third are Jack Two assuming sole ownership; the fourth is Jack One attempting to transfer the deed to a separate couple.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKnow more?

With over six decades in the business \u2013 and hundreds of exhibitors from around the world \u2013 Orgatec has long become more than just a furniture show. It's now a biennial barometer of what's happening in the workplace: the trends and insights that are transforming the office as we know it.\n\nFrom high-tech workstations to near-silent setups, here are the top 7 trends from Orgatec 2016.\n\nVersatility breeds collaboration\n\n\nIt's a message that has been growing louder and louder over the past few years: no two workers are the same. As the creative individualism of employees is increasingly celebrated, employers are seeing a need for workstations that adapt and react to their various needs and uses. Haworth, for example, showcased the Immense series of tables, calling it a \"microcosm of collaborative space\" with various heights and arrangements to suit meetings, collaborative projects, and independent work. \"Creating a landscape of varied surfaces to support the temporality of meetings, the Immerse table enables work by offering a micro atmosphere that can support groups or the individual; standing or sitting,\" says Haworth.\n\nMeetings are getting shorter and are taking place standing up\n\nIt's no secret that formal meetings waste time and energy. With an estimated $37 billion lost per year in the U.S. to unproductive meetings, employers are keen on making meetings shorter and more relevant. Products like Ongo's Meet & Swing aim to help with this change: the system includes a skinny standing-height table and \"standing supports\" \u2013 aka leaning chairs \u2013 that encourage more movement. \"It brings a touch of freedom to the office and inspired informal exchanges between colleagues,\" says the German company in its press material. \"It is precisely this that often leads to the good ideas that are indispensable in this day and age.\"\n\nTemperature is (finally) becoming employee-controlled\n\nGranted, it's hard to keep everyone happy when it comes to the office temperature. But there's no shortage of research (like this survey and this article) showing how temperature can impact productivity and concentration. Enter German manufacturer Kl\u00f6ber with an inspired solution: Mera Klimastuhl, a desk chair with integrated heating and air conditioning. The customizable chair has a 16-hour rechargeable battery that runs the heating and ventilation through the back and seat.\n\nStanding isn't for everyone\n\nSitting might be the new smoking, but stand-up workstations don't work for all workers. With that in mind, \"healthy sitting\" products are on the rise to help older demographics and other workers that can't benefit from standing desks. There was a wide range of offerings from exhibitors at Orgatec, including Vitra's chair that automatically responds to movement and Actiu's seat designed specifically for millennials. A standout, however, was Kinema's latest iteration of its Active Chair, which offers settings for traditional, elevated, and standing sitting. \"There is no one ideal posture for desk jockeys,\" says Kinema. \"But there is a healthy solution \u2013 a well-balanced combination of standing and sitting, a so-called Stand-Sit-Support-Dynamic.\"\n\nThe office is getting (more) wireless\n\n\"Employees, executives and academics no longer work from traditional offices,\" says wireless charging technology company Zens. \"As location-independent workers, they enjoy personalized digital services in every environment.\" In short: workers don't want to cart charging cables all over the office. At Orgatec, Zens teamed up with office furniture company Sedus to launch workstations integrated with cordless charging points and Qi technology to keep phones, tablets, and laptops charged just by placing them on the worktop.\n\nIn open plan spaces, silence is golden\u2026\n\nAs offices continue to embrace the open-plan set-up, finding solutions to reduce background noise is a constant struggle. \"Hardly any other aspect of modern workplaces is as hotly discussed as the optimisation of the room acoustics,\" says Orgatec's trends material. \"Printing, telephoning, discussing \u2013 even slight background noise can disturb people from concentrating on their work.\" At the show, several companies paired acoustic insulation with visual partitions. Thonet's Canor, for example, does triple duty as a sound dampener, a space delineator, and a bulletin board.\n\n\u2026and personal space is at a premium\n\nAnother issue surrounding open-plan offices is the lack of space for employees to make a call \u2013 or just take a breather. Sound-proof telephone booths amid the bustle aren't brand new, but companies are taking it a step further with mini office spaces that employees can slip into for longer periods. The Micro Office by Czech company SilentLab is a fre"}

However, the judge also said he would cancel the session if he's \"satisifed\" with the government's actions to limit or revoke 2,000 three-year work permits it issued to illegal immigrants after Hanen issued an injunction that limited new permits to a two-year duration.\n\n\"This Court has expressed its willingness to believe that these actions were accidental and not done purposefully to violate this Court's order. Nevertheless, it is shocked and surprised at the cavalier attitude the Government has taken with regard to its 'efforts' to rectify this situation,\" Hanen wrote.\n\n\"The Government has conceded that it has directly violated this Court's Order in [the government's] May 7, 2015 advisory, yet, as of today, two months have passed since the Advisory and it has not remediated its own violative behavior. That is unacceptable and, as far as the Government's attorneys are concerned, completely unprofessional,\" the judge added in his order (posted here). \"Neither side should interpret this Court's personal preference to not sanction lawyers or parties as an indication that it will merely acquiesce to a party's unlawful conduct.\"\n\nSpokespeople for the Homeland Security Department and the White House had no comment Tuesday on the order, which applies to Johnson as well as Citizenship and Immigration Services Director Leon Rodriguez., Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Sarah Saldana, Border Patrol Deputy Chief Ronald Vitiello and Customs and Border Patrol Director Gil Kerlikowske.\n\nHomeland Security spokeswoman Marsha Catron confirmed Wednesday that the agency is aware of Hanen's order. \"DHS has received the District Court order and is currently reviewing it with the Department of Justice,\" she said. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.\n\nThe Obama administration has run into a series of problems in the immigration lawsuit beyond the policy and political headaches caused by Hanen's February injunction. Hanen's move halted Obama's moves to expand a program to grant quasi-legal status and work permits to more illegal immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children and to create a similar new program for illegal immigrants who are parents of U.S. citizens or green card holders.\n\nHanen and the 26 states suing to block Obama's actions have accused the administration of misleading the court about the fact that about 100,000 immigrants were given three-year work permits under the actions Obama announced in November. The judge said he was under the impression none of Obama's changes to the deferred action program had been implemented when legal arguments played out on the issue earlier this year. Justice Department lawyers have said there was no intent to mislead but that they regret any confusion.\n\nThere was some mention in court filings of the issuance of three-year permits in court papers, but the judge said oral comments by the government's lawyers led him to believe the change to three-year permits had not taken place.\n\nAfter clarifying that point in March, the Justice Department came forward in May to disclose the 2,000 issuances after Hanen's order. Government lawyers said DHS's inspector general is investigating why the three-year permits were issued despite the court injunction.\n\nA federal appeals court panel is scheduled to hear arguments Friday on whether Hanen's injunction should be overturned.\n\nHanen is an appointee of President George W. Bush.\n\n(hat tip: Josh Blackman, representing an amicus in the case)\n\nUPDATE (Wednesday, 10:46 A.M.): This post has been updated with Catron's comment."}

Though Spiegel uses the word \"tap\" repeatedly, it's unclear whether that means the NSA can actually access this data remotely \u2014 the ability to gather data from devices you have physical access to is relatively trivial, especially if that data isn't encrypted and only protected by a passcode.\n\nHowever, Spiegel also reports that the NSA has been able to access the BlackBerry email system, which ostensibly is both encrypted and secure on the company's servers and on its phones. In a statement to Spiegel, the company denied that it had created a back door to its servers for the NSA. BlackBerry has issued similar denials in other contexts, though in the past it has admitted to providing the government of India some level of access in compliance with local law. BlackBerry would not comment directly on these latest allegations.\n\nApparently the NSA was unable to tap into some BlackBerry devices at one point in 2009, but one memo details a 2010 breakthrough in that regard and the memo allegedly noted the success by stating \"champagne!\" Spiegel says that tapping into smartphones was not \"a mass phenomenon,\" and also says that it will provide more details in an article to be published this Monday."}

The president won't say so, but Republican leaders should.\"\n\n\nNot if they're shopping for votes. Recently released statewide polls indicate that marijuana law reform remains a winning issue among voters \u2013 and not just voters in stereotypically 'blue' states. Here's a look at various red states that are rapidly turning \"green.\"\n\n\nArizona\n\n\nArizona remains the only state in America where first-time marijuana possession offenses are classified as felonies, punishable by up to two years in prison. And while a majority of state lawmakers remain unwilling to embrace marijuana law reform (the state has the sixteenth highest per capita rate of pot possession arrests in the nation), their constituents are more than ready to do so. Fifty-six percent of Arizonans support legalizing pot for adults, according to polling data released in May. (A separate Public Policy Poll from last January reported even higher support, finding that 59 percent of Grand Canyon State voters would vote 'yes' on an initiative to regulate the weed like alcohol.) At least one state Representative is listening. Democrat lawmaker Ruben Gallego is backing legislation this session to legalize the production and retail sale of the plant. The measure faces an uphill battle. In 2012, Republican Gov. Jan Brewer filed a lawsuit to try and halt the implementation of the state's 2010 voter-approved medical marijuana law. (A federal court ultimately rejected Brewer's request.)\n\n\nGeorgia\n\n\nNearly 33,000 Georgians were arrested in 2010 for possessing marijuana \u2013 a figure that was the sixth highest in the nation. But according to a just-published statewide Public Policy Poll, a majority of Peach State voters would prefer to see that total be reduced to zero. According to the January PPP poll, 54 percent of Georgians support \"changing state law to regulate and tax marijuana similarly to alcohol.\" Fifty-seven percent of those Georgians surveyed support making cannabis legal for medical purposes. And 62 percent of voters support amending state law to make possession offenses a civil violation punishable by a fine up to $100, but without jail time. (Under present law, the possession of any amount of cannabis is classified as a criminal misdemeanor, punishable by up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine.) Following the poll's release, some state lawmakers have expressed interest in forming a study committee to explore various options to allow for the herb's medical use, including allowing for the options of high CBD, low THC strains of the plant.\n\n\nIndiana\n\n\nFifty-two percent of Hoosiers believe that cannabis \"should be regulated like alcohol,\" according to statewide polling data released in December by Ball State University. A slightly greater percentage of Indiana voters, 54 percent, support replacing the state's existing criminal penalties for marijuana possession offenses with civil fines. It's understandable why most Hoosiers support such changes in law. In Indiana, first-time pot possession is classified as a criminal misdemeanor punishable by up to one-year in jail and a $5,000 fine. In 2010, the FBI reported that police made nearly 13,000 arrests for minor marijuana possession violations. Democrat-sponsored legislation to decriminalize the possession of up to two ounces of pot by is presently pending before Senate lawmakers. However, Republican Gov. Mike Pence has spoken out against reforming the state's cannabis penalties, calling the plant a \"gateway drug.\"\n\n\nLouisiana\n\n\nFew southern states treat pot offenses more harshly than does Louisiana. But while state lawmakers may publically back strict penalties for weed, their constituents do not. Fifty-three percent of voters believe that cannabis ought to be legalized, taxed, and regulated, according to Public Policy Polling data released last fall. Fifty-six percent of voters support decriminalizing the plant and 65 percent support legalizing its medical use. Nonetheless, last year, Senate lawmakers defeated legislation that sought to amend the penalties for repeat marijuana possession offenders. (Under present law, second-time marijuana offenders face up to five years imprisonment and a $2,000 fine. Subsequent offenders face up to 20 years in prison!) Democrats have reintroduced legislation again this year to address the state's odious pot possession penalties. According to state Department of Corrections officials, 1,372 Louisianians are serving sentences for minor marijuana possession. The average sentence is 8.4 years, with 10 people serving life sentences.\n\n\nOklahoma\n\n\nOklahoma's marijuana penalties are among the most severe in America. Under state law, first-time marijuana possession offenses are punishable by up to one-year incarceration and subsequent offenses are punishable by up to ten years in prison. Selling marijuana is punishable by up to life in"}

I'm just a little late to the party for writing something with it, is all.\n\nAnyways, this isn't your traditional Arkos story... and it's a bit weird, probably even for me. The title for this comes from a chapter in Kami Nomi zo Shiru Sekai, specifically the Megami-hen when he is attempting to reconquer Yui. For those that know what I'm talking, you should already know what this entails.\n\nPerfect Heroine\n\n\"Please come again!\" Pyrrha waved backwards at the hair-dresser that called out to her.\n\nOnce she stepped out from the barber shop, she turned and looked back in the window, using it as a mirror to check herself over once again. She wanted to be absolutely sure everything was perfect. After all, today was the big day.\n\nToday was her very first date with Jaune.\n\nShe had almost given up on her feelings ever getting through to him. Until the fateful night of the Vytal Festival Dance. Jaune left briefly, only to return in a dress and asking her to dance. The pure bliss and joy she felt in that one moment\u2026 she didn't even think it was possible to be that happy.\n\nSo overflowing in emotions, she hadn't been able to contain anymore, she had kissed him very publicly\u2026 leading him to asking her on this very date. Of course she had agreed, but\u2026 there had been one stipulation.\n\nIt wasn't anything drastic, at least she didn't think so. He had been really hesitant to agree at first, so maybe it was. In the end, he did accept her stipulation with one of his own. This was something she had no problem with and so their date was set.\n\nSatisfied with the way she looked, Pyrrha gave a content nod before turning around to scan for Jaune. Checking her watch quick, she confirmed that it was about their agreed meeting time. Despite living in the same room together, they set out separatly so each could prepare and had just decided to meet outside this very barber shop.\n\nSo the only thing left to do was wait.\n\n\"Hey~ Come on cutie, why won't you say something to me?\" Pyrrha tensed up, not so much because of the words, but because she recognized who they belonged to. Emerald eyes scanned the bustling sidewalk, looking for the owner. \"If you don't like me, all you have to do is say something.\" It was when he spoke again she finally located him, Russel Thrush of team CRDL.\n\nThe shorter boy with a green mohawk was leaned over, hands in his pockets in a way he probably thought looked cool as he tried to hit on some poor girl. Flanking the girl so she couldn't retreat was Sky Lark.\n\nPyrrha immediately felt for her. For someone like Pyrrha, it had become a practiced habit to brush off annoying flirts, even the more persistent ones and while it never came down to it, well, she was a world-renowned champion so she could take care of herself. This girl didn't seem to have that same ability.\n\nLooking closer, Pyrrha realized that the girl might even be a little taller than her. She had beautiful, flowing blonde hair that was combed straight. She couldn't see her eyes, for they were hidden by bangs at the moment. As for her physique\u2026 well, it was actually kind of hard to tell from the way she dressed.\n\nShe wore a gorgeous blue long-sleeve shirt, the whole thing looking to be several sizes too big as it hung loosely off her frame. Then there was the skirt she had on, equally blue but surprisingly conservative, with it extending all the way to her ankles and completely concealing any leg. This pretty much left the girl's whole figure to your imagination\u2026 and it appeared Russell liked what his was showing him.\n\n\"Since you're not saying anything, that must mean you're free, right?\" Pyrrha couldn't stand to watch anymore as it looked like Russell was about to drag the poor soul off against her will. She didn't think him a bad person or that he would try anything, but he was definitely coming across too strong.\n\nThe girl was absolutely shivering in fear now, arms held up and hands nearly pressed against her mouth. No one else appeared to even notice her distress, the passing by civilians not even suffering a hitch in their step. So when Pyrrha started towards them, a resolute gleam in her emerald eyes, the girl must have somehow felt it because it was at that moment she looked"}

But the game only calculates the interval between each tick once: at the time that the first tick occurs. If your alacrity changes after that, it doesn't make a lick of difference on the tick rate."}

It's a game unlike any other I've seen at PAX, or anywhere really. Part VR experience, part improv comedy exercise, part Twitch experiment, Bobby Throne Saves The World puts players in the pulpit of a cult leader made in the mold of a suave southern preacher. It's clearly a character-driven exercise, down to the special message from Bobby himself in the press release:\n\nGames are about learning, you learn muscle memory, history, communication, stories, and so much more. If games are about learning then I'm here to teach. So what better place to share my ministry with than at the wonderful PAX East show where everyone is learning. I look forward to introducing myself to all these new minds and see them transform right before my eyes\u2026 forever.\n\nAnd introduce himself he did. As I stood and watched a brief Bobby Throne Saves the World demo at PAX East I noticed it didn't take much for a small crowd to form. Many seemed unaware that the video game avatar onscreen was being controlled Wizard of Oz style by a man literally behind a curtain. The real marvel came in how readily some onlookers seemed to be to believe they were interacting with a sophisticated algorithm. Faith, it seems, is in full supply at PAX.\n\nThe gameplay itself is centered around players assuming the role of Bobby, and delivering his sermons as best they can. Users will be scored on things like body language and cadence, and the audience can be made up of other players who simply want to watch. As the Twitch integration for the developing project gets refined it's easy to imagine that soon there will be actual cults of personality forming on Twitch. Well, moreso than there already are.\n\nNo release information has been announced, but you can follow Bobby on Twitter."}

Betaflight is rapidly changing and advancing, as a result, by flashing it to your flight controller you get a cutting edge experience and access to new and developing features. Because it is experimental there are occasionally bugs, these are usually fixed very quickly.\n\nBetaFlight is an experimental fork of CleanFlight\n\nWhy Betaflight is awesome\n\nQuick summary of main flight performing features in betaflight:\n\n\u2013 Gyro sync (always the most fresh gyro data before the loop starts with minimum delay)\n\n\u2013 Overclocked i2c bus to speed up communication with gyro\n\n\u2013 Gyro FIR filter preconfigured forthe cleanest gyro traces to the pid controller\n\n\u2013 Optimized D calculations and filtering for more derivative precision\n\n\u2013 Optimized defaults with main focus on PID1 and PID2 (reduced amount of pid controllers for better overview)\n\n\u2013 On F1 targets no need to disable acc anymore to get same performance. Gyro readings get priority when in acro mode.\n\n\u2013 Optimized scheduling in tasks to minimize jitter to motors\n\n\u2013 Fast PWM support in combination with Oneshot125 (This is usefull when you want fixed refresh rate for ESC's up to 4khz)\n\n\u2013 Easy to no tuning. Stock settings for PID1 and PID2 should be very well flyable on most machines. The optimised filters do good job on feeding the cleanest gyro traces to the pid controller loop, which gives better flight experience and easier tuning.\n\n\u2013 Cooler motors and ESC's. Better for equipment due to clean filters.\n\n\u2013 Quaternion logic for Level modes. More precision, less drift and faster performance!\n\n\u2013 Beeper selectable for different events\n\nMore reasons why Betaflight is awesome\n\nAside from improvements to the control system, two recent features have made BetaFlight very popular:\n\nAir Mode \u2013 This makes it considerably easier to do acrobatic manouvers. Conventionally below mid throttle the effect of stick movements is gradually listened until at zero throttle they have no effect (and frequently the props are stopped anyway). This is great for landing and slow accurate proximity flying as it prevents stick movement at low throttle causing the quad to move aggressively, however, for acrobatics such as flips and rolls, it is exactly the reverse of what is required, for these, the pilot chops the throttle when inverted so the quad is not driving its self into the ground at full throttle, however he wants the quad to manoeuvre aggressively to complete its flip or roll. Air mode addresses this with full impact of stick movement being applied even at zero throttle (the quad should have its props spinning even at zero throttle \u2013 something not all pilots currently do and takes a little getting used to). The net result is the quad can flip and roll quickly with the minimum loss of altitude.\n\nESC Pass through Flashing \u2013 BetaFlight and recent releases of CleanFight allow the pass through flashing of ESCS using the USB connection to the Flight controller, removing the requirement to use flashing tools and disassemble the quad to update the ESC firmware.\n\n**WARNING** Betaflight is exactly as the name suggests, BETA software. This means that it is experimental. We do not recommend that beginners to the hobby flash Betaflight. We recommend that newcomers stick with Baseflight or cleanflight.\n\nBETA FLIGHT IS FOR EXPERTS ONLY\n\nHow to flash the flight controller with BetaFlight (A Step by Step guide)\n\nThis is a step by step guide to flashing your flight controller with BetaFlight including the new Air mode, followed by pass through flashing of BLHeli ESCs.\n\nDetails of BetaFlight can be found at the link below, note that this is a very busy thread:\n\nhttp://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2464844\n\nIn this blog entry we will go through a step by step flash of BetaFlight followed by a BLHeli Firmware Flash. The examples used are based on a Sparrow Racing 270mm frame with a Naze32 rev6a acro flight controller, an OSDoge, a FrSky X4Rsb and FVT Littlebee 20a ESCs, other components are irrelevant to the steps shown.\n\nAlthough the configuration used has Arm and Air Mode on separate switch settings it is possible to activate air mode before take-off as Air mode will not take effect even though enabled until a short delay after the quad receives input on both the throttle and Pitch/roll.\n\nIn the interest of safety Props should be removed from the quad during the entire process.\n\nIn order to flash your flight controller with"}

I recently watched all nine seasons in a few months, and decided that I absolutely had to recreate the iconic work space with LEGO Digital Designer. Before I knew it, what had originally been a small, forgotten LDD file of Micheal Scott's desk evolved into a 2599 piece scale model The Office.\n\nThe model.\n\nIn order to be realistic, I tried to copy nearly every detail on every desk. Out of the month of building I put into this, the majority of the time was devoted to tweaking the details on all the desks. Every desk has a computer and a phone by default, but each one also has its own unique details (some more than others).\n\nTo make the rendering of images easier, I added a few pieces that allow Micheal's office and the conference room to detach from the rest of the model. Also, although no images of this are included, the wall on the far right is connected to a hinge that allows the other half of the model to be opened up. These functions make it easier to view and detach different parts of the model and adjust the position of the minifigures.\n\nThe minifigures.\n\nA total of 16 minifigures are included along with the model. They all (for the most part) include accessories that appeared during some point on the show. Alternate wigs, hats, and bodies are also included to recreate classic moments from the show.\n\nLarger accessories are included for some of the minifigures such as Kevin's drum set.\n\nA list of minifigures and accessories is as follows:\n\nMicheal: \"World's best boss\" mug, Dundie award, Santa hat.\n\nJim: Dwight's stapler in Jell-O, Dwight costume.\n\nDwight: Bobble head, beet, pumpkin head.\n\nPam: Paint brush, paint palette.\n\nKevin: Chile pot (\"The trick is to under cook the onions.\"), M&Ms jar, drum set, drum sticks.\n\nAngela: Assorted stuffed animals, cat (\"Save Bandit!\").\n\nOscar: Printed computer screen with \"Kevin as Cookie Monster\" parody.\n\nErin: Candy bowl, purse.\n\nPhyllis: Knitting project, knitting needles, assorted stuffed animals, Santa suit with hat.\n\nStanley: Pretzel, crossword puzzle.\n\nAndy: Banjo, microphone and stand.\n\nMeredith: Wine glass.\n\nCreed: Mung beans (\"I sprout mung beans on a damp paper towel in my desk. They're highly nutritious but they smell like death.\")\n\nDarryl: Keyboard, boxes of Dunder Mifflin paper.\n\nToby: Complaint folder.\n\nKelly: Pink iPhone.\n\nRyan: I couldn't think of any distinct accessories for Ryan, but I'm thinking maybe a t-shirt.

It culminated in them bankrupting him over a \u00a31,350 debt in 2006, seeking to evict him from his home, which was worth in excess of \u00a3200,000, that he owned outright.\"\n\nThe report goes on to quote a Central Beds Council spokesman explaining that the unpaid \u00a31,350 represented legal costs incurred by the council and its solicitors in pursuing Mr Williams \u2014 but, if you'll forgive me colloquialising, \"it ain't our fault, guv, honest\" because the debt had been handed over to Grant Thornton, acting as bankruptcy trustees, and apparently they were the ones behind the eviction proceedings as part of the debt recovery process.\n\nThe council, on the other hand, were right there supporting Mr Williams:\n\n[The spokesman] added that the council's emergency duty team was in touch with Peter earlier this month and referred him for an urgent mental health assessment. Last year the Local Government Ombudsman investigated the council's relationship with Peter and said there were no grounds on which to criticise the council.\n\nSo where does that leave us? A man with known mental health problems, hounded to death over a council tax dispute, and a blameless council. Maybe I'm missing something here: I never knew Peter, even though he lived in the same village as me, and unlike the Local Government Ombudsman, I'm not privy to the ins and outs of Peter's story and have only the Chronicle report to go on; but assuming the accuracy of that report, I have a couple of simple questions for Central Beds Council:\n\nWho let the dogs out? Since you knew about Peter's mental health problems, why didn't you call them off?\n\nSeems to me that transferring a debt to a third party, then denying all responsibility when that third party's pursuit of that debt results in a tragedy such as this, simply doesn't wash, any more than Pontius Pilate washing his hands absolved him of responsibility for the death of Jesus.\n\nNo one should be hounded by debt collectors to the point where they can see no way forward beyond taking their own life; and when a person has a known record of mental health difficulties, even more caution is called for.\n\nWhich begs the question: was it suicide, or murder?\n\nA shortened version of this post has been sent as a letter to the Biggleswade Chronicle.\n\nAdvertisements"}

But the rest of us want a Republican Party that can compete across the board in 2016.\"\n\nMichael Steel, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, had a similar response when asked about impeachment: \"The speaker has said we have no current or future plans to go down that path.\"\n\nThe discussion comes as Obama travels on Friday to Las Vegas, where he is expected to discuss the immigration move. Under plans being constructed by the White House, up to 5 million undocumented immigrants could be shielded from deportation. The White House says such action is necessary because Congress has not acted on a larger immigration bill and that it is within his bounds of his authority to prioritize immigration enforcement.\n\nBut Republicans, who view the move as an unconstitutional power grab, are still struggling with their legislative response. The most clear avenue is the government financing bill, which needs to pass by Dec. 11 to avoid the second shutdown in as many years. There's debate within the GOP over several possible avenues, including splitting up an omnibus package to fund most of the government through next September but limit the funding of immigration policies in order to tie the president's hands.\n\n\"Congress will be funding the government, but it doesn't have to be everything the president wants,\" said Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a chief foe of comprehensive immigration legislation.\n\nIf a spending bill with restrictions on immigration passes the GOP House, it's unlikely to win backing in the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats until January. So Republicans are considering passing a continuing resolution to keep the government afloat until mid-February and respond more forcefully then, when the GOP controls both houses of Congress.\n\nDoing that, however, risks enraging conservatives who want a more muscular response right now.\n\n\"Instead of just talking about it, we need to do something to show the president that there are consequences to trying to do a run around the Constitution and Congress,\" Cornyn added.\n\nRepublicans want to seize on the divisions within the Democratic Party over the move. Several moderate Democrats, including Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkmap of North Dakota, as well Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, criticized the president's plans.\n\n\"I would encourage the president not to take that step until we've exhausted everything, to see if Boehner can give us a vote on something,\" said Manchin, a former governor of West Virginia.\n\n\"The better course would be wait, see how the next Congress reacts,\" Heitkamp said. \"The president is the president, he's going to make his decision, but I think the better course is to delay this a period of time and allow the Congress to do what they should do, which is deal with an issue of national importance.\"\n\nAdded King: \"I worry that his taking unilateral action could in fact inflame public opinion, change the subject from immigration to the president. I also have constitutional concerns about where prosecutorial discretion ends and unconstitutional executive authority begins.\"\n\nStill, it's hardly clear that any of these disaffected moderates want Congress to either use the funding bill to tie Obama's hands or take even more draconian actions against Obama. So Republicans argue they need to be careful in how they choose to respond to avoid pushing these Democrats onto the side of the president.\n\n\"Anybody who does that kind of talk right now will be considered pretty erratic and excessive,\" said Utah's Orrin Hatch, the longest-serving Senate Republican, when asked about impeachment. \"Let"}

{"id": 259052, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "One year from now, the 2012 Olympic Games will begin in London, where all eyes will be on the incomparable Usain Bolt -- the Jamaican sprinter who is more than living up to his name.\n\nSince 2008, Bolt has taken a jackhammer to the 100-meter world record, lopping off a whopping .14 seconds. That might not sound like a huge chunk of time until you consider it's twice as much as any other sprinter has shaved off the world record since the advent of electronic scoring.\n\nLogically, one would think that Bolt did so by moving his legs faster than anyone else. Only he didn't.\n\nSpeed, as it turns out, may be completely misunderstood.\n\nWhen Bolt established the current 100-meter world record in the 2009 world championships, running it in 9.58 seconds, he did so by moving his legs at virtually the same pace as his competitors. In fact, if you or I were to compete against Bolt, our legs would turn over at essentially the same rate as his.\n\nThis is a theory put forth by academics and track coaches alike who contend that running fast has more to do with the force one applies to the ground than how quickly one can move one's legs.\n\nMore than a decade ago, Peter Weyand, a science professor at Southern Methodist University, conducted a study on speed. Comparing athletes to non-athletes, Weyand clocked both test groups as they ran at their top speed. What he found shocked him.\n\n\"The amount of time to pick up a leg and put it down is very similar,\" he says. \"It surprised us when we first figured it out.\"\n\nSo if leg turnover is the same, how does one person run faster than another?\n\nWeyand discovered that speed is dependent upon two variables: The force with which one presses against the ground and how long one applies that force.\n\nThink of the legs as springs. The more force they can push against the ground, the further they can propel the body forward, thus maximizing the output of each individual step. In a full sprint, the average person applies about 500 to 600 pounds of force. An Olympic sprinter can apply more than 1,000 pounds.\n\nBut force isn't the only factor. How quickly that force is applied factors in as well.\n\nFor this, think of bouncing a beach ball versus a super ball. The beach ball is soft and mushy and when bounced on the ground sits for a while before slowly rebounding back into the air. Conversely, a super ball is hard and stiff and when bounced rebounds almost instantaneously -- and at a much faster speed than the beach ball.\n\nThe average person's foot is on the ground for about .12 seconds, while an Olympic sprinter's foot is on the ground for just .08 seconds -- a 33-percent difference.\n\n\"The amount of time [one's legs are] in the air is .12, regardless if you're fast or slow,\" Weyand explains. \"An elite sprinter gets the aerial time they need with less time on the ground to generate that lift -- or to get back up in the air -- because they can hit harder.\"\n\nSo what makes Bolt faster than even the elite sprinters? And can he run the 100 meters even faster than 9.58 seconds?\n\nBolt's superiority is often explained by his unique combination of height, strength and acceleration.\n\nAt 6-foot-5, Bolt is two inches taller than fellow Jamaican Asafa Powell (pictured together below) and has six inches on American Tyson Gay -- two of his closest challengers. While it takes most elite sprinters 44 strides to complete 100 meters, Bolt does it in 41.\n\n\"Would you rather take 44 steps to your car or 41?\" asks Dan Pfaff, who coached Canada's Donovan Bailey to the 100-meter gold during the Atlanta Games in 1996.\n\nPfaff, now working in London to help boost Great Britain's track-and-field hopes for 2012, says Bolt's height gives him a distinct leverage advantage.\n\n\"If you're digging a hole in the ground, you have to get a longer lever to pry [out a rock],\" he explains. \"If you can control those levers and make them work efficiently, it's a huge advantage.\"\n\nIt's Bolt's ability to control the levers that is so unusual for a sprinter his height.\n\nWhile taller sprinters may be able to reach a higher top-end speed, getting up to that speed isn't as easy. This can be explained physiologically -- smaller people can exert more force in relation to how much they weigh -- but Weyand prefers a more simple visual to show this to be true.\n\n\"You can easily imagine a 4-foot-10 gymnast doing a triple back flip, but imagine Shaquille O'Neal or Yao Ming doing it,\" he"}

And roughly 21 percent of black workers are public employees, compared with 16.3 percent of nonblacks.\n\nA Crumbling 'Pillar' Of The Black Middle Class\n\nBut government jobs, long considered the most secure form of employment in America, have rapidly disappeared since the start of the last recession in December 2007 \u2014 particularly at the state and local levels, where officials have cut budgets to cope with declining tax revenues and the rising costs of unemployment benefits, employee pensions and Medicare.\n\nPublic Sector Job Growth\n\nGovernment has shed 2.6 percent of its jobs over the past three years, marking the greatest reduction in history, according to the nonprofit Roosevelt Institute, a progressive-leaning organization. Roughly 265,000 workers were shed from all levels of government last year, after about 221,000 job cuts in 2010.\n\n\"Most government jobs have good pay and benefits and are probably what we would consider a good foundation for middle-class incomes, so any loss of government jobs is going to disproportionately hit the middle class,\" says Howard University research scientist Roderick Harrison. \"The black population, which is more dependent on government for middle-class job opportunities, is going to be more heavily hit.\"\n\nPublic Sector Vs. Private Sector Job Growth\n\nThough the recession has ended, government job losses continue to be one of the most powerful drags on the economic recovery.\n\nIn April, private employers added 130,000 jobs, but that growth was partially undermined by the loss of 15,000 government jobs. As a result, the net growth of 115,000 jobs fell well below most economists' projections and was down from March's revised 154,000 jobs added. The unemployment rate dropped slightly, to 8.1 percent.\n\nAfter the civil rights gains of the 1960s opened opportunities in government, blacks began a steady move into local, state and federal government, particularly in civil servant and teaching positions. And since the collapse of U.S. manufacturing, the public sector has been the biggest employer for African-Americans.\n\nBeyond the jobs themselves, their relatively competitive pay scales have lifted generations of blacks into the middle class. Berkeley's labor center found that among industries that pay blacks the highest wages, the biggest proportion of those blacks work in the public sector.\n\nThe earnings gap between whites and blacks, which exists in all industries, is the narrowest in government, the Berkeley research has shown.\n\nFor every dollar earned by white government workers, black women in government earn 89 cents and black men earn 80 cents. Overall, black women earn 85 cents and black men earn 74 cents for every dollar earned by whites.\n\nCuts Trigger Resentment\n\nBut that security is waning. To express their frustrations about the economy, many African-Americans often invoke an old metaphor, to their chagrin: When everyone else gets the sniffles, we catch the flu. April's jobless rates bear out the same, showing unemployment for whites at 7.4 percent, Latinos at 10.3 percent and blacks at 13 percent.\n\nThe three pillars of middle class African-American life were the public sector, good manufacturing jobs, and black entrepreneurs that served the black community during segregation.\n\n\"The three pillars of middle-class African-American life were the public sector, good manufacturing jobs, and black entrepreneurs that served the black community during segregation,\" says economist Steven Pitts, who led the Berkeley Center's research. \"With the end of segregation, you put pressure on the black entrepreneurs, and then there was the decline in manufacturing.

PGC-1\u03b1 is responsible for stimulating the expression of \"clock genes(S).\" Clock genes are components of the circadian clock responsible for generating oscillations of gene expression(S).\n\nPGC-1\u03b1 is \"a key component of the circadian oscillator that integrates the mammalian clock and energy metabolism(S).\"\n\nThis means that problems in the Circadian Rhythm can lead to Metabolic problems, and Metabolic problems can lead to Circadian Rhythm problems(S).\n\nUpon activation, PGC-1\u03b1 also induces the transcription of NRF-1 and NRF-2(S).\n\nNRF-2 is specifically known for its role in increasing the genes that are responsible for increasing our bodies own antioxidant system.\n\n***This is the reason why increasing mitochondrial number and mass does not equate to increased ROS and cell damage.***\n\nThe same factor (PGC-1\u03b1) that drives mitochondrial biogenesis also increases our bodies' ability to control ROS (NRF-2)(S).\n\nSide note: You can increase mitochondria without activating the PGC-1\u03b1 pathway. However, in mice that had this pathway silenced \u2013 the mitochondria showed a reduced resilience to stressful conditions. In other words, mitochondria are stronger with PGC-1\u03b1.\n\nOk, now for the fun part!.\n\nMitochondrial Boosters\n\nFree Methods:\n\n1) DIET : Ok, so food isn't exactly free, but you have to eat anyway \u2013 so it's not exactly an added expense like adding a supplement would be\u2026 The food you choose to eat can be directly responsible for stimulating PGC-1\u03b1 and mitochondrial biogenesis.\n\nHowever, the opposite is also true.

It could order your kids home from school and in some cases, kick you out of your job, at least temporarily. Health officials can inspect your house, open up your health records and maybe even seize your remains if you get sick and die.\n\nThe government has to have a lot of discretion, and to treat individual health care and public health differently, Minnesota health commissioner Ed Ehlinger said.\n\n\"Sometimes, public health goals and outcomes really conflict with that individual privacy,\" he said. \"If someone has an infectious disease and doesn't want to be quarantined or isolated, we sometimes have to do that for the protection of the general public. And that's what public health is all about. And that's where the potential struggles are going to be.\"\n\nThat idea dates back to the very beginnings of the U.S. health care system in the 19th century.\n\n\"We tried to quarantine people coming in from other places that had cholera or other infectious diseases,\" Ehlinger said. \"The public health service was established to really quarantine folks coming from outside the country.\"\n\nDallas officials ordered the family of Ebola victim Eric Duncan into a quarantine after they didn't go into seclusion voluntarily. And New Jersey officials ordered NBC health correspondent Nancy Snyderman to stay in her home after she violated a voluntary quarantine request and was spotted at a restaurant. One of her colleagues contracted Ebola when they were in west Africa recently.\n\nMinnesota offers some guarantees to people it suspects might get ill, such as ready communication with health care providers and the chance to appeal a quarantine order in court, according to attorney James Conway, of Shakopee, who studies state law and quarantine The state also requires authorities to use the least restrictive environment possible for quarantine.\n\nConway doesn't forsee widespread legal challenges to quarantine, but said it raises a host of issues: What does \"least restrictive\" mean? Who decides? And what happens while people wait to see if they'll really get sick?\n\nAnother worry: job loss. Federal workplace protection laws may help some people, Conway said. \"The Americans with Disabilities Act might apply to someone in a detention situation, so that they would likely not have fear of losing their job if they were placed under a quarantine.\"\n\nIn Minnesota, there are laws protecting employees and even a provision to recover lost wages in the event of an outbreak, he added.\n\nBut other situations and answers aren't so clear. What about property rights, for example? In Texas, officials stripped bare the apartment where Ebola victim Eric Duncan stayed, packed everything in more than 140 barrels, and incinerated it. The cleanup cost an estimated $100,000.\n\nMinnesota Department of Health spokesman Doug Schultz said authorities have been weighing the practicality of such measures, and the need to clean up potential hazards, versus the risk of exposing more people to infection. Officials have decided to call the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency to people's homes if any so-called \"Ebola houses\" turn up in the state.\n\nPeter Sandman, a risk communication consultant in New York, said its hard to know how much authority it would take to stem an Ebola outbreak in the United States. But whatever the rules, Sandman said the key to making them work will be to apply them fairly,\n\n\"There's a real tension between protecting everybody's health and protecting everybody's liberty,\" he said. \"But if you start diminishing some people's liberty but not other people's liberty, then that calls the whole enterprise into question.\"\n\nLike everyone else, he hopes we won't have to find out if that happens."}

Most famous historical places, untouched nature, hidden beaches where the water is so clear that the boats in sea appear like they are floating in the air, not to mention the gastronomy, and this is just the beginning. As expeienced guides we would love to invite you to join us on our Blue Cave and six island tour. Blue Cave is a natural phenomenom which is situated 1 hour and 30 minutes from Split's main harbor, on Bi\u0161evo island. The next destination will be surprise destination - but it wouldn't be a surprise if we revel it to you now. The Monk seal Cave consists of a spacious outer part, and the inner narrow and darker part with the underwater opening to the partially shaded place where it housed a type of seals that got the name, the Mediterranean Sea Bear. The local people called him Sea Bear or Sea Cow, while his Latin name was Monachus monachus, in translation - a monk. In this 70-meter-long and 4-meter-wide cave they lived, they were born and perhaps died, also nicknamed the sirens of the Bisevo island. The last ones were seen somewhere in the 60s of last century. The cave is very mysterious and attractive, and the attractiveness increases if you are lucky maybe to see one of the sea bears. Stiniva is one of the most famous coves on Vis island, and certainly has the most unusual form. It is located on the south side of the island, bordered by high cliffs that leave only four meters close to the entrance from the sea. After passing through the \"door\" , it opens a beautiful rounded bay with a pebble beach. Stiniva was declared the most beautiful beach in Europe in 2015. Our next destination is a small paradise on earth situated between 3 islets Blue Lagoon on Budikovac island. Blue Lagoon is one of the prettiest locations in the middle part of the Adriatic for snorkeling and swimming. Here you can let your self be lazy and enjoy in tranquility in one of the most beautiful seas in the world.

All Rights Reserved. Personal use only; commercial use is strictly prohibited (for details see Privacy Policy and Legal Notice). date: 26 September 2018\n\nInfluence of Labeling and Incivility on Climate Change Communication\n\nSummary and Keywords Labels play an important role in opinion formation, helping to actively construct perceptions and reality, and to place individuals into context with others. As a highly complex issue, climate change invites a range of different opinions and dialogues about its causes, impacts, and action required. Much work has been published in the academic literature aiming to categorize differences of opinion about climate change using labels. However, the debate about labels acts as a distraction to more fundamental and pressing issues of policy response. In addition, the undercurrent of incivility present in the climate change debate also contributes towards a hostile and unconstructive conflict. This is an evolving area of academic enquiry. Recent work has examined how the different labels of climate change opinions are constructed, used in practice, and portrayed differently in the public and policy spheres. The growing number of categorization systems used in the climate debate are also argued to have implications for the science-policy interface, creating a polarized debate involving many different actors and interfaces. Moving away from unhelpful use and construction of labels that lead to incivility would enable constructive and fruitful dialogue across this polarized debate. A way forward would be to explore further the role of underlying motivations and rationales as to why these different opinions about climate change come to exist in the first place. Focusing on potential overlaps in perceptions and rationales may encourage constructive discussion amongst actors previously engaged in purposefully antagonistic exchange on climate change. Keywords: climate change debate, labels, opinion, incivility, communication\n\nIn 1942, the sociologist Robert K. Merton introduced an influential conceptualization of scientific norms. These informal rules included communalism\u2013that scientists should all be able to access scientific knowledge; universalism\u2013that all scientists should be able to contribute to the creation of that knowledge; and disinterestedness\u2013that all scientists should act for the greater good, rather than personal gain. But most notably among these Mertonian norms, is the emphasized ideal of organized skepticism. By way of this norm, all scientific claims should be subject to \"an ongoing process of questioning, hypothesizing, validation, and refutation\" (Sarewitz, 2000, p. 84) before they may be accepted. Even once they are accepted, they must continue to be questioned should new evidence emerge. The positivist tradition of contemporary science is strongly based on the idea that skepticism is a fundamental basis of the scientific process. Importantly, it emphasizes that conflicting arguments should be based either on flaws in existing evidence or on the production of new, contrary evidence. In the context of climate change, scientific debates may focus on overarching topics or specific physical relationships. Topics that have been debated include, for example, the relationship between sunspots and climate change (Huntingford & Fowler, 2008), the impact of clouds on climate feedback mechanisms (Baum, Haqq-Misra, & Karmosky, 2012), or whether or not specific weather events may be attributable to longer term climate change (Parmesan & Yohe, 2003). Disagreement about climate change is not surprising. As Merton first articulated, debate and the continued questioning of all findings and conclusions are fundamental parts of the scientific process. Climate change is a complex issue to communicate, particularly to non-scientists. This is additionally challenging when it is assumed that simply communicating about the science of climate change is sufficient to increase understanding, engagement, and willingness to act. This is known as the \"technocratic model\" or the \"information deficit model\" (Hulme, 2009; Sturgis & Allum, 2004); however, this linear approach often raises significant challenges in communication and debate on climate change. This is because viewpoints on contentious topics are not solely decided by evidence and may be influenced by many other factors (as we outline below). Nonetheless, the expectations of participants in the climate debate, notably decision-makers, can lead to an over-reliance on evidence-based policy that cannot necessarily be fulfilled, particularly where large uncertainties are involved and where decision-making processes are highly context-dependent (Dessai, Hulme, Lempert, & Pielke, 2009). Research into the boundaries of the science-policy interface has enabled a deeper understanding of how to manage the challenges that emerge in the climate debate (Jasanoff, 1990, 2004). Science that is used to inform decision-making needs to be perceived as credible (e.g. that it is rigorously assessed and reviewed), salient (e.g. that it is relevant to debate participants such as decision-makers), and legitimate ("}

Although he reveals many talents, this yearning shows in his dislike of coming in first, as the cast eventually realizes. He becomes quite bothered when someone disrupts his \"simplicity\", and goes to extreme lengths to get it back. He keeps a collection of his own fingernail clippings, and believes when they grow quickly he has trouble. Kira also has a bizarre fetish for the female hand, stemming from an erotic fascination with the hands of the Mona Lisa. Unfortunately, his desire has never extended to the rest of the female person.\n\n\nHe is the main antagonist of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond is Unbreakable.\n\n\nOriginally, Kira murdered his victims by stabbing them so viciously they were left with horrific back wounds (their hideous nature is implied by the fact that the reader is never actually shown Reimi's wound). However, his Stand, Killer Queen, eventually awoke from his desire to leave no evidence behind of his killings\u2014hence its ability to make its victims completely disintegrate. He now lets Killer Queen annihilate his victims (except for his \"girlfriend\"-hands), letting everyone else think that the victims have simply gone missing.

So when I got the opportunity to make some jewelry out of zippers, I jumped on the chance.\n\nThe zippers for this tutorial are from K and C Supplies. You can find all sorts of colors and varieties of zippers in the online shop here. (Plus buttons! Oh, yes, there will be a button jewelry tutorial soon, too!)\n\nLet's get started!\n\nMaterials and Tools:\n\n3 \u2013 7 inch YKK Zippers. Pick them up at K and C Supplies.\n\n12 Fold over crimp ends. Available at any craft store.\n\n7 mm jump rings\n\nLobster clasp\n\nScissors\n\nChain nose pliers and another pair of pliers\n\nOptional materials for customizing your bracelet:\n\nBeads\n\nHead pins\n\nLucite flowers\n\nStep #1\n\nWe're going to separate each zipper into 2 parts. So flip over the zipper and find the little metal throngs on the back. Just bend them up with chain nose pliers and pull it off.\n\nThen just slide the pull down and off the zipper. (Definitely save this for other projects!)\n\nALTERNATIVELY (and this is easier, but you lose a little of the length of the zipper.)\n\nAlternatively you can just cut across the zipper right above that little metal thing at the end. Like I mentioned, you will lose a some of the length of the zipper and ultimately your bracelet by doing that.\n\nRepeat this for all 3 zippers. Whichever way you chose, do it the same for all of the zippers.\n\nStep #2\n\nUse scissors to cut along the side of the zipper teeth. You'll end up with a thin strand of just the teeth. (Save the excess for a project I will share later.)\n\nRepeat for each zipper. You'll end up with 6 of these.\n\nStep #3\n\nAdd a crimp end to each end of each zipper. Just place the end in the crimp end and fold over each side. Then push it closed.\n\nHINT: I like to pull on the crimp end to make sure it's secure before moving on.\n\nStep #4\n\nOpen 2 \u2013 7mm jump rings.\n\nOpening a jump ring may be different than you think. Line up 2 pairs of pliers so that the opening of the jump ring is in the middle.\n\n(I usually use a pair of bent nose pliers and a pair of chain nose pliers. Use whatever pliers you feel comfortable with.)\n\nMaintaining the integrity of the circle, pull one pair the the pliers toward you and the other away from you. Do not pull the circle apart and do not pull to the sides.\n\nThis is what you end up with.\n\nTo close a jump ring, just do the same, but the opposite.\n\nI also made a video tutorial about how to properly open and close jump rings:\n\nStep #5\n\nAdd the end of all 6 zippers to one jump ring. Then close the jump ring.\n\nStep #6\n\nSecure the end to something. (I used some wire and hooked it to a basket.)\n\nBraid the zippers. I made 3 groups of 2 zippers each and just did a regular braid.\n\nStep #7\n\nGather the other end and hook them all in another 7 mm jump ring.\n\nStep #8\n\nOpen another 7 mm jump ring and connect the lobster clasp to one end of the bracelet. Then add a few 7 mm jump rings to the other end of the bracelet.\n\nThat's the basic zipper bracelet.\n\nHere are some ways to customize it:\n\n(Feel free to get creative here!)\n\nMake a couple of bead dangles. I used flower beads.\n\nFor a video tutorial on how to make a bead dangle, here's a video I made:\n\nThen add the dangles to the end of the bracelet using a jump ring.\n\nWant to take it a step further?\n\nMake some more bead dangles. Click here to learn how to make these dangles with Lucite flowers.\n\nAdd them to the bracelet in various places using jump rings. I used 4mm jump rings so the dangles would stay in place, but if you would like them to have some movement, use 7mm jump rings.\n\nAnother Version:\n\nInstead of making a braided bracelet, you could make a single bracelet. These would look awesome stacked. Imagine a bunch of different colors down your arm. You can add a dangle like I did here, or just keep them plain.\n\nHave fun making zipper bracelets! Let me know how they turn out!\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013\n\nWant more free"}

Which characters are at the top and which ones are at the bottom? You may be surprised.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIf you are unaware, Nintendo announced that the company is letting fans vote for which character they'd want to see as DLC in Super Smash Bros for Wii U and 3DS. After all the votes have been tallied, it is up to Nintendo to choose whether or not the character is viable for the game.\n\nThrough the use of Topsy.com, I was able to find the most popular character choices on Twitter. Here is how I worked it out: Topsy finds how many times a word has been used by Twitter users on the website.\n\nI searched both the character's name and \"smash\", and then searched the character's name in a hashtag with 4smash at the end like this: #wonderred4smash. I combined both of these sources with the characters I believed were the most talked about and have compiled them into a list. Here is what I found as of the evening/early morning of 4th/5th April 2015.\n\nNOTE: This is all a bit of fun. This is not proof of which characters are being voted on the most, this is how much they are mentioned and even that has variables. There may be a chance I forgot to include a character to research as well. Check it out for yourself and let me know if you came across anything different.\n\n1) Shovel Knight\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYes, that's right. A character from an indie game is the most requested for the game on Twitter. Yacht Club Games, the developers of Shovel Knight, have been behind the campaign for the character to be in the game. There is no indie representation in Smash Bros. yet, and with the company's recent open stance with independent studios, it would only make sense. Plus, Shovel Knight would fit right in with its platforming attacks and variety of skills at his disposal. Also, if they were to include the stage, hearing the soundtrack within Super Smash Bros would be pretty rocking!\n\n2) Banjo and Kazooie\n\nBanjo and Kazooie were platforming icons on the Nintendo 64, but the developers, Rare, were bought by Microsoft in 2002. The only game they've been in since is Banjo and Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts for the Xbox 360. However, Phil Spencer (Head of Xbox) said on Twitter, \"I think it would be cool if Banjo was in the next SSB DLC. We've worked with Nintendo on Rare IP before, no issues.\" It just depends on whether or not Nintendo would be willing to work with Microsoft for their inclusion. Banjo and Kazooie would be cool to have included, as many fans remember playing the game on the Nintendo 64 when they were younger, and want to see them return in some shape or form. The character is being pushed by Playtonic Games, the developers of a spiritual sequel to Banjo and Kazooie, on Twitter.\n\n3) Wonder Red\n\nThe main character from Platinum Studio and Nintendo's The Wonderful 101 leaps in at the number three spot of this list. With the power of the other 99 heroes, Wonder Red could have some cool moves, and give Captain Falcon a run for his money on the hype factor. The vast number of mentions being made towards Wonder Red is surprising as Satoru Iwata mentioned at a investor financial call earlier that the game undersold. Popular Let's Players, The Two Best Friends Play (actually there are 4), lend their support for this campaign on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n4) Sora\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArguably one the most shocking inclusions out of this list is Sora from the Kingdom Hearts series. Originally on the PlayStation 2, Kingdom Hearts has had four releases on Nintendo platforms, which include Chain of Memories, 358/2 Days, Re: Coded, and Dream Drop Distance. The characters have starred in Nintendo consoles almost as much as Sony's platforms. Also, a few dedicated Kingdom Hearts YouTubers, HMK and TheGamersJoint may have been behind the surge of Kingdom Hearts fans who want Sora to be a part of the game. HMK has 36,000 subscribers, and TheGamersJoint has 59,000 subscribers. With a blend of melee and ranged magical attacks, Sora could be a great addition. Personally, this is my pick.\n\n5) Bayonetta\n\nAnother Platinum Games character, Bayonetta, has made the fifth spot on the list. The seductive witch has cast a spell on many on Twitter. With the action heavy nature of the game, and plenty of combos to draw upon, Bayonetta could make for a great fighter.

An assistant professor at Oberlin College and strident proponent of boycotting Israel on campus, Karega moonlighted as an unhinged anti-Semite on social media. On her Facebook page, she labeled ISIS a \"CIA and Mossad operation,\" claimed Israel downed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, said the Mossad perpetrated the Charlie Hebdo attacks, posted a video arguing that Jews perpetrated 9/11, and shared an anti-Semitic meme of Jewish banker Jacob Rothschild that proclaimed \"We own your news, the media, your oil, and your government.\"\n\nAfter the exposure of Karega's hateful propagandizing was met with a muted response from the university\u2013its president defended Karega's academic freedom, yet did not exercise his own to condemn her statements\u2013Oberlin's board of trustees was forced to step in and condemn the postings as \"anti-Semitic and abhorrent.\" It called for a full investigation into Karega.\n\nAmidst all this controversy about Karega's lurid anti-Semitic outbursts, however, a much wider and more troubling failure by Oberlin has been overlooked. Because the truth is, the scandal at the prestigious school is much bigger than one professor's anti-Semitism.\n\nAs the New York Times reported, Karega, a professor of rhetoric and composition, teaches \"social justice writing courses.\" According to Oberlin's course catalog, one such class is \"RHET 204 \u2013 Writing for Social Justice.\" In it, \"Students will develop, negotiate, and revise their own writing strategies and ethics as they write on social justice issues relevant to their interests.\"\n\nIn other words, Oberlin hired an unrepentant bigot to teach undergraduates to write about justice and guide them in their moral development.\n\nThis astounding fact suggests that the entire hiring process for social justice-related fields at Oberlin is fundamentally broken and easily gamed. After all, it's difficult to imagine a greater or more systemic failure than Karega being chosen to teach students how to communicate about moral causes.\n\nSeen in this light, the debate over whether Oberlin should discipline or fire Karega is a distraction from an even more serious reckoning. Because whether Karega herself leaves or stays on, Oberlin must account for itself far beyond one individual professor. It must ask how its hiring committees missed the signs that they were contracting a bigot to teach ethics. What questions did they fail to pose during the interview process? What areas of the applicant's background and past work did they fail to investigate? Did any members of the faculty who chose Karega share her prejudices and thus allow them to slide? If Karega could slip by, who else might have?\n\nOn the other hand, if the school merely scapegoats Karega while letting off those who enabled her to come in contact with undergraduates in the first place, Oberlin will have demonstrated that it is not interested in addressing its prejudice problem, but rather suppressing its symptoms.\n\nPrevious: Oberlin Students Receive Anti-Semitic Email from Self-Proclaimed 'Truthseeker'\n\nYair Rosenberg is a senior writer at Tablet.

{"id": 259087, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "It is no secret that major changes were made to the background, plot, and dialogueue of Phantasy Star while it was being translated from Japanese to English. It is also known that some changes, such as having the main character of Phantasy Star IV be named \"Chaz\" and not \"Rudy,\" were done on purpose and were completely unnecessary. Why this was done we may never know, but the result is that the two versions of Phantasy Star are as different as they are alike.\n\nThe following is our attempt to document every known difference between the Japanese and English Phantasy Star titles. Some, like the above-mentioned name changes, are minor and make no real alteration to the games' plots. Some, like the origin of Algo, are incredibly major and are the changes most responsible for the two separate continuities we call The Two Phantasy Stars.\n\n(Note: PSOPC stands for The Phantasy Star Official Production Compendium, a book published in Japan by Soft Bank and translated into English by Rebecca Capowski. All quotes attributed to the PSOPC come from Rebecca's translation.)\n\nPhantasy Star I\n\nDate: Japanese PSI takes place in AW 342. English PSI takes place in Space Century 342.\n\nThis change seems minor at first, but when PSII's date is taken into consideration, the change becomes more profound. Japanese PSII's date is AW 1284, which means 942 years have passed since Japanese PSI. However, according to English PSII's opening narration, \"over 1000 years have passed\" since English PSI. While the change from \"AW 342\" to \"Space Century 342\" was obviously deliberate, we doubt that the change from a 942 year gap to a 1000 year gap was, as well. However, though unintentional, this is still a major difference which alone places the Japanese and English Phantasy Star series on different continuity timelines.\n\nOn a related note, regarding the AW calendar, in Japanese Phantasy Star, AW stands for \"After Waizz,\" referring to Waizz Landeel, Alis's ancestor and the first to establish a fiefdom on Palma, some 342 years before Japanese PSI. However, the fact that Waizz Landeel is never mentioned in any English Phantasy Star game, along with the fact that the AW calendar does not debut in English Phantasy Star until PSII, raises the possibility that the origin of the AW calendar may be yet another difference between the two Phantasy Stars.\n\n\nLassic's Corruption: The PSOPC refers to the following events as having taken place a year before Japanese PSI: \"La Shiec learns the secret of the Algol Solar System's genesis. Forming a space-time gate, he comes into contact with the sealed-away spirit-life form. As a result, he summons the projected body of the Profound Darkness, Dark Force, and becomes its loyal servant. That same year, a reign of terror begins.\"\n\nThis is much, much different than the explanation given for English PSI in English PSI's instruction booklet: \"It started with a new religion which was rumored to have come from another galaxy. The dark priests of this religion, never seen by any mortal, promised immortality to all who joined. ... The idea of living forever appealed to him [Lassic] so he became the first to join. Then, he... changed. It started with the threatening suit of armor the priests made for him. The armor looked evil and corrupt, and that's how Lassic began to rule his people.\"\n\nIn other words, in Japanese PSI, the force that corrupts Lassic is something that he seeks out; in English PSI, the corrupting force seeks him out. This change is major because this implies that in English PSI there are other forces at work behind-the-scenes in Algo with a plan to corrupt Lassic, while no such implication exists in Japanese PSI.\n\n\nAlis's fate: In Japan only, Sega released two Phantasy Star titles for the Game Gear, Phantasy Star Adventure and Phantasy Star Gaiden. It is noteable to mention that Phantasy Star Gaiden even featured the return of Alis Landale, and the introduction of her daughter! However, as these games were never released in America, they are not necessarily a part of the English canon (and their canonity in the Japanese Phantasy Star universe is also questionable).\n\n\nCharacter Names: In order to accomodate English PSI's four character name arrays, certain Japanese names like Alicer and Tylon had to be changed to short, four-letters-or-less names like Alis and Odin. However, in Japanese PSI, the character known in the English version as Noah was named Lutz. Obviously, \"Lutz\" would have fit into a four character array, so this change must be considered deliberate. This name change would also contribute to a"}

He also had nine rebounds and three blocked shots, looking spry and explosive off the floor on his numerous two-handed dunks.\n\nHe also made two of the three three-pointers he made, a phase of his game Purdue's given him leeway to explore, particularly perhaps when he's at the 4 when Haas is in at center.\n\n\"He said as long as they're good shots, smart shots and not really contested, he said I'm allowed to shoot them. I'm glad about that,\" Hammons said.\n\n\"It might surprise some people a little bit. They might not be expecting it. And if people close out hard on me, I can drive it a little bit. I do have a floater game you all haven't seen yet (joking). We're working on that.\"\n\nHaas, meanwhile, scored 17 points with seven rebounds. A few of his field goals came head-to-head against Hammons down low. Otherwise, he lived at the foul line and made 11-of-13.\n\n\"He got great position, kept the ball really high and he hit all his free throws,\" Hammons said.\n\nPurdue relishes having Hammons and Haas practicing against each other for the competition it's brought to the practice floor.\n\nBut it will continue to explore their potential as a tandem.\n\nHe will take part in next week's scrimmage - Saturday at 3 p.m. and open to the public - though.\n\n\"I thought he was great,\" Painter said. \"He's probably not been through a full practice in a week-and-a-half, two weeks. He's jumped into a couple and gotten hurt right away.\n\n\"He's been better in practice,\" Painter said. \"He didn't have a good day today, but he's done some good things. His ability to stretch defenses is going to be a weapon for us.\"\n\nStephens was one of several Boilermakers to struggle from deep, as the team made just a combined 5-of-40.\n\nMathias was 0-for-5 and Rapheal Davis 1-of-7.\n\nOther double-figure scorers for Purdue were P.J. Thompson (12 points) and Scott (11).\n\nPainter and Scott each said that the sophomore is solely being used at the point guard position right now, though Scott said he thinks he might get opportunities to play some away from the ball."}
{"id": 259089, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "By TTT Subscriber John P. Houghton (John P Hughton).\n\nThis is a review of Red or Dead, David Peace's book about Bill Shankly. We've already carried one review, by Andrew McKay, but as Andrew's did, this has its own distinctive view of the novel:\n\nRed or Dead, David Peace's new novel about the life of Bill Shankly is a love story \u2013 with a complicated ending.\n\nBill Shankly loved many things: Liverpool Football Club; his wife Nessie; hard work; the city of Liverpool; and the ethos of collective socialism that he saw reflected in the city and articulated in the words of 'You'll Never Walk Alone'.\n\nHe had devoted his life to all these things and, as he lost some of the vigour of his youth and realised how much time he had missed with his wife and daughters, he decided to choose between his devotions.\n\nHe put his actual family before his footballing one, and shocked by the world by resigning from Liverpool Football Club.\n\nWhat happens next is a story we all know. At least, we all think we know it.\n\nThe club turned its back on its greatest servant. After fifteen years of devotion, during which he turned a sleeping second division side into an emerging European giant, he was treated like a pariah.\n\nIn this telling of the story, Shankly becomes an almost semi-vagrant ghost living a sad half-life. Unwanted and eventually exorcised from Anfield, he drifted around, playing football with kids in the streets and even turning up to lend a hand at Goodison.\n\nPeace's interpretation is more nuanced, and does Shankly a greater service. In Red or Dead, Shankly knows he can't hang around the club. He had seen the ultimately destructive impact of his good friend Matt Busby's decision to stay on and lend a hand at Old Trafford. The club couldn't move out of the shadow of the great man, and were relegated within a few years.\n\nShankly knew he had to make another sacrifice by staying away. The exile was self-imposed as much as anything else. He wanted his team to have a legacy beyond him \u2013 and that could only be achieved without him. This version gives Shankly a lot more credit than the traditional telling of the tale.\n\nResigning in 1974, Shankly was also walking away from a football world, and wider society, that was rapidly moving away from his vision of collective socialism. This is illustrated by the few points in novel in which the Shankly-focused narrative is punctuated by events in the outside world: Conservative election victories, the growth of hooliganism, urban decay, rising unemployment and economic crises. In a section that reads like a haunting premonition of Hillsborough, 66 Glasgow Rangers fans were crushed to death in an inadequate stadium.\n\n\"Liverpool is not in England\"\n\nA rich, round man emerges from Red or Dead.\n\nWe meet the hard Shankly, making cold-blooded decisions to offload players as he re-built his first great but ageing team (this hardness toward old and injured players was discussed in this episode of TAW with Ragnhild 'Ronnie' Lund Ansnes). We meet the philosophical Shankly, discussing politics at length in the transcribed interview with Harold Wilson near the end of the book.\n\nWe meet the deeply caring Shankly, traumatised by the suicide of club secretary of Jimmy McInnes, virtually begging his successor Peter Robinson to go home and get some rest. We meet the canny, manipulative Shankly, as demonstrated in an incident with a semi-naked Ian St. John, a tin of boot polish and a Polaroid camera (seriously, you'll have to read that bit for yourself).\n\nThe other great character in the book is the city of Liverpool, as represented by the voices on the Kop. Shankly saw his values reflected in the city. Socialism, although the city has not been as left-wing as people think, as Steve Graves discusses in the TAW Mag #2. Loyalty to a collective ambition. A determination to walk together and avoid what Martin Luther King described as the \"drum major instinct\", the selfish \"desire to lead the parade\" instead of walking lock-step in solidarity.\n\nThat's what the Kop's singing in Red or Dead seems to represent. Not just the ability to create a barrage of sound, but to reinforce the living bond between the players and crowd. No stars, no one bigger than the team, but a unity of purpose between the men on the field moving the ball and the men off it, moving the players with their voices.\n\nShankly repaid this with a deep commitment to the city. When asked by a journalist how he could love a city that appeared to be nothing but \"huge tracts of wasteland\", Shankly responded that he could only see \"a"}

The film was a huge critical success and made 2.5 times its budget. It has spawned a devoted fanbase, including an ironic gay fandom that has adopted the title monster as a gay icon.\n\nPlot\n\nThe Babadook centers around a mother and child living in the aftermath of the father's death, which occurred when he was driving the mother to the hospital as she was in labor. The child, Samuel, is difficult, and the mother, Amelia, is exhausted with the behavior of her son. One night, they read a pop-up book called The Babadook, which has mysteriously appeared in their house. The book tells the story of Mister Babadook, a tall man in black with a top hat who, once let in, cannot be eradicated until he kills the host. Amelia is disturbed by the graphic story and Samuel becomes convinced the monster is real. As the story unfolds, Amelia grows increasingly manic as she is unable to tell what is real and what isn't, and is perhaps becoming infested with the Babadook.\n\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe film was Kent's first full-length film and was produced on a budget of $2.5 million. It was shot in Adelaide, Australia and interior shots were mostly filmed in a soundstage. A Victorian terrace house was built specifically for the film. It premiered in January of 2014 at the Sundance Film Festival and had a limited run in Australia that year, premiering in just 13 theaters. It initially opened in only 3 theaters in the United States. However, following positive critical reception, it was able to grow to a massive success.\n\nReception\n\nThe film was very positively reviewed, with a 98% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an 86 rating on Metacritic. Critics praised the film's moving story and commitment to horror without jump scares, as well as the performances from the two leads.\n\nFandom\n\nFan reception to the film has been strong as well. On Facebook, The Babadook has over 160,000 likes. There is also a large amount of fan art on DeviantArt devoted to The Babadook. One notable instance of Babadook fandom was posted to Twitter on June 30th, 2016, when writer Katie Dippold tweeted about a Halloween party she attended dressed as the Babadook only to discover it wasn't a costume party (shown below). Her tweet gained over 76,000 retweets and 146,000 likes and was covered by New York Magazine.\n\n\nGay Icon\n\nIn early 2017, a joke that The Babadook was gay began spreading through Tumblr and eventually Twitter. On December 10th, 2016, Tumblr user Taco-bell-rey uploaded a screenshot of The Babadook appearing in the LGBT section of Netflix. The post gained over 126,000 notes, and likely launched the idea that The Babadook was a gay character and icon.\n\n\nThe idea continued to spread throughout Tumblr as ironic, trolling discourse. On February 15th, 2017, Twitter user @Broderick uploaded screenshots of such dialogue, gaining over 5,000 retweets (shown below).\n\n\nThe meme drew its most attention when June, LGBT Pride Month, began. Then, the jokes about Babadook's gay identity spread with such fervor they were covered by Mashable and Teen Vogue (examples shown below). As of June 7th, much of the Tumblr discourse around the Babadook centers around him being a gay icon.\n\n\nSearch Interest\n\nExternal References"}

Beckham had 2.5 yards of separation on Norman when the perfectly placed ball struck his hands.\n\nA similar scenario played out early in the third quarter when Manning targeted Beckham on a 40-yard throw. Beckham gained 2.08 yards of separation by the time the ball left Manning's hand and a gaping 4.25 yards when the ball hit the ground on a misfire caused by Panthers defensive end Charles Johnson.\n\nBeckham also beat Norman on a 10-yard sideline pass, only to drop a low pass from Manning.\n\nIn total, Beckham won enough routes versus Norman to leave roughly 100 yards and a touchdown on the field.\n\nNFL Films senior producer Greg Cosell put it in even starker terms after meticulously reviewing the all-22 film.\n\n\"Norman did match up to Beckham, but they didn't play man coverage very often. And in fact, Beckham killed him,\" Cosell said this week on the Fantasy Guru Matchup Podcast. \"I watched every play and I studied it hard because I knew it would be a topic of conversation. Beckham was beaten mentally. ... But physically, it's not even close. Norman can't cover Beckham.\"\n\nNorman is a worthy Defensive Player of the Year candidate and should join Patrick Peterson as the first-team All-Pro cornerbacks this season. But he certainly didn't \"shut down\" Odell Beckham in the Panthers' shootout victory.\n\nIf anything, Beckham shut himself down for 57 minutes.\n\nHere's what else we learned from Next Gen Stats in Week 15:\n\n1. While that receiver-cornerback clash failed to produce a clear victor, the same cannot be said for the showdown between Steelers wideout Antonio Brown and Broncos corner Chris Harris in their own shootout at Heinz Field. Entering the game, Harris hadn't surrendered a touchdown since Week 12 of the 2013 season. It was realistic for the Broncos to believe the ultra-stingy Harris could hold his own versus Brown, while Aqib Talib concentrated on Martavis Bryant and Courtney Roby trailed Markus Wheaton. That wasn't the case. Harris battled, but Brown still burned him for 147 yards and a pair of touchdowns on 13 receptions and 15 targets in Harris' coverage.\n\nHarris just earned his second straight Pro Bowl nod. He's one of the best in the business. Brown is on another level.\n\n2. Sammy Watkins isn't quite at Brown's level, but he's trending in that direction. Watkins is fourth in receiving yards and third in receiving touchdowns over the past five weeks. Emerging as one of the NFL's most dangerous deep threats, Watkins reached 22.13 mph on his 48-yard bomb -- the second-fastest speed on a touchdown catch this season. The previous week against Philadelphia, Watkins had the fourth-highest speed (21.15 mph) on his first-quarter touchdown. As well as he's playing, it's understandable that he would be calling out underperforming teammates for not putting forth the same effort level.\n\n3. The rebirth of Darren McFadden -- written off as washed-up prior to his age-28 season -- has been a bright spot in an otherwise dark Cowboys season. McFadden covered an efficient 3.27 yards per rushing yard gained versus the Jets, reaching a max speed of 21.27 mph on a 33-yard run. He now owns two of the five highest speeds at the position over the past two weeks. Even though McFadden didn't join the starting lineup until Halloween, Adrian Peterson is the only player in the league with more 100-yard rushing performances this season.\n\n4. Cardinals rookie David Johnson was even more efficient in covering just 2.93 yards per scrimmage yard gained versus the Eagles. Johnson's total distance traveled of 671 yards was the most of any Week 15 running back, resulting in 229 yards from scrimmage. The tackle-breaking 47-yard touchdown run that channeled Marshawn Lynch's \"Beast Mode\" covered more distance (69.48 yards) and reached a higher speed"}

Blink-182\n\nGreen Day WITH: Saves the Day. WHERE: Post-Gazette Pavilion, Burgettstown. WHEN: Tomorrow at 7 p.m. TICKETS: $32.50 advance; $34.50 at door. 412-323-1919. Justin Stephens Blink-182 -- Mark Hoppus, Travis Barker and Tom DeLonge -- has the support of fans and the critics are coming around. While it's not exactly the Beatles-Stones or the Clash-Sex Pistols rivalry, the meeting of Green Day with Blink-182 is decent fodder for a pop debate. The argument probably wouldn't last long though, seeing as how it would pit the rock critic and record store music geek (Green Day) against the dazed MTV watcher just as likely to be listening to Pink as Blink. The common ground is that both bands are bratty, both are thrashy, both have been known to traffic in teen angst, but by most accounts, Green Day gets the upper hand, not only for leading that first wave of punk revival in the '90s, but for being less of a cartoon, if that's at all possible. Green Day recovered from the backlash that followed the success of the amazing \"Dookie\" to become something of a classic rock band. It's no accident that they were the ones honored with covering for the Ramones a few months ago at the punk band's induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In the summer of 2002, however, Blink-182 is the stronger contender in the pop market. Green Day's \"Warning\" -- a midtempo affair that kicked off with the sound of an acoustic guitar -- limped to gold and fell off the charts after 25 weeks. Getting the bigger media push was Blink's the crunchier (and I'd say better) \"Take Off Your Pants and Jacket,\" which dealt with some serious issues despite the prank name. Blink's record debuted at No. 1, just went double platinum and is hanging in there after 48 weeks. The Pop Disaster Tour puts them on the same stage and, although they've played down the battle, you can bet they'll be looking to outgun each other. Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong told Rolling Stone, \"I look at it as a challenge, as a sort of drag race.\" Here's the tale of the tape: Green Day Blink-182 Formed: Berkeley, Calif., 1989. Poway, Calif, 1993. Original name(s): Sweet Children. Duck Tape; Blink. What's their age again?: Billie Joe Armstrong 30; Mike Dirnt 30; Tre Cool 29. Mark Hoppus 30; Tom DeLonge 26; Travis Barker 26. Sound like: Buzzcocks, Sex Pistols. Descendants. Biggest indulgence: Fake British accents. Frat-boy stage chatter. First big package tour: Lollapalooza, 1994. Warped Tour, 1996. Biggest gig: Riotous mudfight at Woodstock II. MTV Millennium bash. Biggest sellers: \"Dookie\" sold 10 million! \"Enema of the State\" sold 3 million. On growing up: \"We're not gonna try and act immature for the rest of our lives. Our band is not an inside joke. We write real songs and we want to grow older with class. And with dignity.\" Dirnt to PG, 2001. \"There's plenty of time in your life to worry about bills and to grow up and all that [stuff], and you only get one chance to be young and I'm gonna hold onto that for as long as possible.\" Hoppus to PG, 1998. Bragging rights: Tre Cool called \"Warning\" an \"instant classic.\" DeLonge on \"Dammit\" (to the Web site Launch): \"It was easily more progressive than the Offspring songs, Green Day, or Rancid.\" Greatest exposure: Armstrong was arrested for mooning a Milwaukee audience in 1995, setting him back $141.85. Blink: No shirts, no pants in video for \"What's My Age Again?,\" earning them TRL domination. Punk credibility: Standing in for the Ramones at Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction. Henry Rollins told the PG, \"If in 1984, Blink-182 would have opened for [Black Flag], our audience would have beat the crap out of them...\" He also said of Blink's sound, \"It's very catchy and if I was in 9th grade I'd be like all into it.\" Biggest award: Best Alternative Album Grammy for \"Dookie.\" MTV"}

{"id": 259098, "ended": true, "length": 519, "text": "Interference with a Tuning Fork If you strike a tuning fork and rotate it next to your ear, you will note that the sound alternates between loud and soft as you rotate through the angles where the interference is constructive and destructive. It is challenging to visualize this in a diagram because of the large difference in scale between the tuning fork and the wavelengths of the sound produced. A tuning fork to produce equal tempered middle-C (C 4 , 261.6Hz) would have a dimension of a few centimeters, but the sound wavelength at room temperature would be about 1.3 m or over four feet. This is an attempt to qualitatively visualize the interference from a binary source using a photo of the interference pattern in a ripple tank with a double vibrator. That photo is superimposed on a sketch of a tuning fork in the hope that it might give some insight about the nature of interference in waves from a double source. But the scale here is profoundly different: the separation of the two ripple tank wave sources is several wavelengths, whereas the separation of the two tines of the C-tuning fork is maybe 1/50th of the wavelength. This pattern would suggest several minima of loudness, whereas the tuning fork gives four minima at 45\u00b0 from the plane of the two tines when rotated. Animations of the interference patterns with single and multiple sources may be found at Dan Russell's site at Penn State. The pattern at right is from the animation of a lateral quadrupole source. This is the best approximation of the interference of the tuning fork since the two tines of the fork are out of phase, and Russell notes that two opposite phase dipoles make up a lateral quadrupole source. This diagram gets closer to what you experience by rotating the tuning fork by your ear, but the problem of scale is still present since the sound wavelength for the C tuning fork is fifty times the size of the physical vibrator. This diagram shows that Russell's lateral quadrupole gives equal intensities at 90\u00b0. But with the tuning fork, your ear tells you that the maxima in the plane of the two tines is significantly stronger than the maxima perpendicular to that plane. Each tine of the fork produces a pressure wave which travels outward at the speed of sound. One part of the wave has a pressure higher than atmospheric pressure, another lower. At some angles the high pressure areas of the two waves coincide and you hear a louder sound. At other angles, the high pressure part of one wave coincides with the low pressure part of the other."}

's review\n\nI read this book while hang-gliding over the coast of Liechtenstein. It was difficult to grip the jacket of the book, not only because I was airborne, but because the night before I was in Moscow having vodka and gasoline with Luis San Baptista Rodolfo Sr., a ex-foot soldier for the Revolutionary FALN, and my head was POUNDING! I told Luis over a dinner (red cabbage over braised Skeletor Dolls) I had never seen the last episode of Family Ties, and he instantly grew furious, and cried out, \"Matushka! Matushka! My cauliflower is on fire!\" and thrust a copy of \"Waiting for Godot\" into my pocket, and whispered into my big toe, \"Listen, my friend, I only have a credit card, so I put on my visa and you give me cash, no?\"\n\n\nI immediately understood Luis' implicit instructions: the only proper way to read Beckett truly, to feel the power of his words, is to do so while manning non-mechanical aircraft.\n\n\nAt first I found Beckett's dramatic universe too glib, even watery, like a Burmese jungle cat. I found the dialogue too reliant upon the use of words. I thought the use of characters instead of sandwiches or tuxedos was trite and derivative. I also found the verdant pastures of Liechtenstein simply enchanting from an aerial point of view. Several times, I found myself questioning my decision to question my decision to use McDonald's wrappers from the Basque Region for the material of my hang-glider's wings, but then I realized, that's the point: having no discernible narrative thru-line is STILL a narrative thru-line all the same. Beckett's brilliance touched me at last. (But without permission, so I'm suing him in the Hague.)\n\n\nSo, I'm giving this a 5. Not a strong five. But not a weak five either.

For three and a half hours, they were abused, humiliated and assaulted by a mob of 15-20 people that passed communal remarks and accused them of carrying beef in a bag.Finally, a 19-year-old was stabbed to death and another received stab injuries. The GRP at Ballabgarh railway station failed to intervene and stop the assault.The GRP claimed on Friday to have arrested a man and detained a suspect allegedly involved in the attack.Haryana DGP B S Sandhu, however, denied that the incident was the outcome of an argument over beef. \"This was a clash between two groups which resulted in the death of one person. We have already arrested one of the accused. Police teams are investigating and others too will be arrested,\" he told TOI.The youths, from Khandoa village near Ballabgarh, had boarded an EMU at Sadar Bazar around 5.30pm. Junaid, the teenager killed by the mob, and his brothers \u2014 Mohsin, Haseem and Moeen \u2014 were carrying gifts and food for their family members and had packed them in plastic bags.Haseem (20) said that they had occupied two seats and were playing ludo when the train reached Okhla station. Around 15 to 20 people boarded the Mathura-bound train and asked them to vacate the seats. When they refused, the men abused them with communal remarks.They started calling us names and said we were unpatriotic and anti-nationals and then started hitting us. They were pointing at a packet which had food and saying that we should not be allowed to sit since we were carrying beef,\" said Haseem. They denied they were carrying beef and tried to reason with the men but they became even more aggressive.Moeen (17), Junaid's cousin, said they finally got up, somehow managed to free themselves from the mob and moved to the adjacent coach but the men followed them there, hurling abuses.\"We decided to get down at Faridabad station and take another train to Ballabgarh but the men blocked our way and asked the other passengers to prevent us from leaving,\" said Mohsin (18). \"We pleaded with them to let us go but we were caught between two seats. And there was a crowd at the exit.\" Scared that they would be attacked again, Mohsin called their brother Shakir, asking him to reach the station with some help.When they tried again to get off at Ballabgarh, a heated argument ensued. Shakir had responded to their call and boarded the train. Some men in the mob now pulled out knives and attacked Junaid when he tried to force his way out. \"He was pinned by four men and stabbed repeatedly till he fell unconscious.When Shakir and Moeen tried to intervene, the men caught Shakir and stabbed him in the throat, chest and hands,\" said Mohsin.He said since the train had started moving, they pulled the chain but it didn't work.Mohsin said everything was happening in plain sight of GRP personnel at Ballabgarh railway station but they refused to help them. \"To save ourselves, we called the police and the emergency response number but there was no response,\" he said.The train reached Asavati station around 9pm where they were pushed out before the train left for Mathura. They were taken to the civil hospital at Palwal by family members who had hired an ambulance from a local hospital.Junaid was declared brought dead. Shakir was referred to AIIMS Trauma Centre where he is said to be critical. Mohseen and Moeen too were admitted to the civil hospital while Haseem was discharged after treatment.The SHO of GRP at Ballabgarh police station, Surat Pal, admitted that they couldn't rescue the four youths due to the crowd at the station. \"One of them, Mohsin, called an ambulance when his brother was stabbed. Such things happen.Whenever there is a riot or fight, such things happen and people say some communal things but we can't do anything,\" said Pal quite nonchalantly. \"The fight took place over seats. We are trying to identify the other accused.\"Union information and broadcasting minister M Venkaiah Naidu has condemned the incident. \"No one should take the law into their own hands. Even if there was a rumour, no one has the right to do this. The agencies should look into it and see who are behind this,\" he said."}
{"id": 259101, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Cordova whitelist and Content Security Policy guide\n\n9 minutes to read\n\n9 minutes to read Contributors\n\n\nIn this article\n\nOne of the more confusing changes about Apache Cordova 5 that have continued on in Cordova 6 is that the updated version of the Android platform and iOS now follow a different, but more powerful security model designed to provide developers with the tools needed to prevent cross-site scripting attacks among other issues. A critical aspect of this security model is that absolutely no network access of any kind is allowed without the installation of a Cordova plugin.\n\nCordova Whitelists\n\nThe new Cordova Whitelist plugin (cordova-plugin-whitelist) is the recommended base security plugin to use for managing network security access. Historically there was one access element in config.xml used to control all access to network resources. For example, adding the following to config.xml resulted in the app not only being able to make XHR calls, access images, or reference remote scripts but also allowed Cordova to navigate to any URI.\n\n<access origin=\"*\" />\n\nThe problem with this model is you might want to be able to make an XHR to a service like Azure Mobile Apps without actually allowing your app to navigate to an Azure web page in the same domain. The reason this is a concern is that this remote web page is then given access to all Cordova and plugin APIs. Further, for Android, the access element has been overloaded to control \"intents\" in the wake of a discovered security issue in Cordova 3.5.0 and below which has led to a syntax that strayed away from the original W3C Widget spec that config.xml's structure is based on. Some restructuring and improvements were therefore appropriate for the Cordova 5.0.0 release.\n\ncordova-plugin-whitelist\n\nAs a result, the new whitelist plugin actually introduces three separate elements designed to enable more discrete control. The access element returns but only controls where your app can make XHR requests or access other external content from a web page for Android and iOS. It no longer controls whether you can navigate to a different domain. A new allow-navigation element has been added that then enables you to specify where the app can navigate instead. Finally, a new allow-intent element has been introduced specifically designed to control Android intents.\n\nThe base Visual Studio and Cordova CLI template (via the cordova create command) has a config.xml file in it that is designed to allow the app to make external requests anywhere, allows a specific subset of intents, and prevents the WebView in the Cordova app to navigate anywhere other than local content.\n\n<access origin=\"*\" /> <allow-intent href=\"http://*/*\" /> <allow-intent href=\"https://*/*\" /> <allow-intent href=\"tel:*\" /> <allow-intent href=\"sms:*\" /> <allow-intent href=\"mailto:*\" /> <allow-intent href=\"geo:*\" />\n\nIf we wanted to add the ability for the root WebView to navigate to www.microsoft.com, we can add this XML element:\n\n<allow-navigation href=\"http://www.microsoft.com\" />\n\nNote If you simply wanted to display www.microsoft.com without giving it access to Cordova or plugin APIs, you can use the InAppBrowser plugin without adding the allow-navigation element to your config.xml file. InAppBrowser allows navigation to any URI and a small subset of intents. It is intended for use in situations where you want to include content from an untrusted source.\n\nThere is still some variation in behavior by platform for these whitelist features based on the concerns and capabilities of the underlying native technology.\n\nAndroid supports the use of access, allow-navigation, and allow-intent. Intents are an Android specific concept. iOS supports the use of access and allow-navigation. As of 6.0.0 (Cordova iOS 4.0.0) it is built into the iOS platform so a plugin is not required. Windows 10 via the Windows platform supports the allow-navigation element exactly like iOS and Android. The access element is also supported but behaves a bit differently in that navigation is allowed to these URIs but Cordova and plugin APIs are disabled thereby reducing risk. In Windows 10, XHR, CSS, and image access rules are intended to be controlled by a Content Security Policy (CSP) via connect-src rather than specific whitelists. We'll cover more details on how to use CSPs later in this document. Windows 8.0, 8.1, and Windows Phone 8.1 via the Windows platform does not support navigating to external URIs outside of the InAppBrowser plugin due to fundamental platform limitations. XHR calls are always"}

Let's see the ratting charts first: Well, well, the fruits of years of continous neglecting of highsec are now obvious: there are less PvE activity in highsec than in nullsec. While nullsec ratting increased a bit it's not the reason for the change but quick decrease of highsec activity. And you know what correlates very well with highsec PvE activity. The most bizarre result of this change can be seen on Dotlan : Goons are now literally the biggest carebears of New Eden. While they are ratting more than ever, the main reason of the change is the serious decrease in highsec, as Deklein only increased by 0.9M: The most important is to see how quickly Providence returned to their high position in ratting. Let's see the alliances: Goons reached their record so far, due to Deklein being down on the CFC loss list (beaten by Vale and Pure Blind). Their ratting concentration is 4x higher than the Nullsec average, showing that CCP made a serious mistake listening to the Document of Shame , a joint venture of Nullsec overlords to remove conflict from Nullsec. With the increased anomaly count there is absolutely no reason to take the land of another group, there are enough anoms for 4x more nullsec people than current, not just as a theoretical possibility, but as an everyday practice. I'd suggest to decrease anom count in all systems to 1/4 of current. Soviet-Union continues its march up the chart, now being #3 ratter. The xxDeath renters are not only down but extremely underutilizig their space, just like B0T renters, but at least they are a bit up. Razor and CVA both returned to pre-war ratting while xxDeath proper decreased their activity. September was record for the Imperium in absolute numbers, but as it was huge for whole nullsec, their percentage record is still May. These are obviously not the numbers I want to see but since CCP completely removed conflict from nullsec, we can't hope that any other Sov owner will fight them (see how Providence attempted no retaliation for the earlier Imperium attacks). We must wait (and send support) until MoA grows to the point where they alone can make ratting impossible in Deklein."}

When I visited it as a child in the 1940s, its appearance was basically the same, so the above photo depicts Sunnyside as I remember it. Photo from the Mike Filey collection, in the Toronto Archives.\n\nToday we live in a world where people are extremely mobile and well-connected via social media. Toronto in the 1940s was vastly different. Few households owned a phone, due to the high rental costs, and cell phones were science fiction, relegated to the comic sections of the newspapers. Automobiles were prohibitively expensive, and were not being manufactured since the companies were busy assembling tanks and vehicles for the war in Europe and the Pacific. Adding to the difficulties of owning a car, rubber tires and gasoline were rationed.\n\nThus, 1940s Toronto was a narrower world than that of today. People tended to purchase or rent houses within close proximity to friends and relatives, so they were able to walk to each others' houses to converse about the trials and joys of life. Chatting with neighbours often occurred over a fence in the back garden, particularly on Mondays, which was washing day for most families. Corner stores and greeting neighbours when walking along the sidewalk also provided opportunities for exchanging information. For more important news, such as the war front, most households owned a radio. To keep in touch with family members who lived beyond the neighbourhood, a visit by streetcar or bus was necessary. If they were further afield, hand-written letters or postcards were sent.\n\nBecause owning an automobile was beyond the reach of most households, the majority of families were confined to the city. If they wished a day-trip away from the neighbourhood, in summer they visited places such as High Park, the Humber Valley, Scarborough Beach, and Kew Beach. Centre Island and Hanlan's Point were other popular summer destinations, a ferry ride across the harbour considered an added attraction. However, in my family, the favourite day-trip was a visit to the Sunnyside Amusement Park and the sandy beach nestled beside it. Even on the hottest day, the breezes from the lake were cool and refreshing.\n\nWe always arrived at Sunnyside via the Queen Streetcar, disembarking at Roncesvalles Avenue, where it intersected with King and Queen Streets. Walking across the Sunnyside railway bridge, we descended the iron stairs to the amusement park below. As we walked past the rides, which included an enormous rollercoaster named the Flyer, I longed to be of an age to climb aboard them. Alas, I was confined to the merry-go-round, now usually referred to as a carousel. Where Sunnyside's rides were located is today where the Gardiner Expressway exists.\n\nThe merry-go-round at Sunnyside in 1945. It was eventually relocated to Disneyland in California. The Flyer (rollercoaster) is evident in the background. Photo from the Toronto Archives, SC 139-2, Box 148489.\n\nThe History of Sunnyside\n\nIn 1912, Toronto's city councillors voted to erect an amusement park at Sunnyside, to the west of the downtown, beside lake Ontario. Projected to cost $19 million, work began in 1913, but construction stopped when the First World War began in 1914. After the war, the project resumed, and over 1400 acres of land were reclaimed from the lake. The final stage was to landscape the newly created land with top soil and sodding.\n\nBy 1919, as work on Sunnyside proceeded, it was evident that a new roadway was required, which meant replacing the old Lakeshore Road. Completed within a year, the 54-foot-wide, four-lane Lakeshore Boulevard West was opened. Two year later, on June 28, 1922, the amusement park was officially inaugurated by Mayor Mcguire. At the time, Sunnyside Amusement Park had not been completed, but a few of the rides and the Bathing Pavilion were ready for visitors. The Bathing Pavilion, designed by Alfred Chapman, costing $300,000, accommodated 7700 bathers, and had a roof garden where 400 guests could purchase refreshments and snacks. To enter the pool, the cost was 25 cents for adults and 15 cents for children. However, there was a 1100' free bathing area to the south of the Pavilion, and another at the western end of Sunnyside, close to the east bank of the Humber River.\n\nAfter its official opening in 1922, thousands strolled the boardwalk at Sunnyside, swam in the waters of the lake, or dived into the new swimming pool. The Palais Royal, built at a cost of $80,000, also opened the same year. Walter Dean's Boat Building Factory was in the basement level, so only the main"}

This is a significant increase compared to the next option for US Internet customers, which is a 1 Gbps fiber connection for $65 per month.\n\nHowever, for customers living in Minneapolis, the only other options for Internet providers are Comcast and Century Link, both of which do not offer connections anywhere near as fast as what US Internet is offering. Both companies don't offer fiber connections at all.\n\nCustomers included in the coverage area that are willing to pay for the massive Internet speed upgrade will have to wait though. The technology being used for the 10 Gbps connection is fiber technology, homes and buildings are required to be wired in a unique way, as the connection is not as simple as plugging in wires to a box.\n\nThe issue lies in the installation process of the fiber technology due to the frozen ground of the city, which is where the fiber wire needs to pass through. According to US Internet, orders for 10 Gbps connections may only be completed by Spring of 2015 when the frozen ground thaws. The company added that connection requests not completed due to the frozen ground will receive priority one Spring comes around.\n\nThis means that currently, only US Internet customers already on the 1 Gbps fiber connection can immediately access 10 Gbps speeds.\n\nThe wait seems to be worth it though, as Caldwell likens the upgrade to \"going from 30 to 10,000 miles per hour.\"\n\nSee Now: 30 Gadgets And Tech Gifts For Father's Day 2018 That Dad Will Think Are Rad\n\n\u24d2 2018 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

He followed the spider web of cracks with his eyes to a small stain in the corner. Leak in the roof, he surmised and wondered if the cheap motel would even bother fixing it. He could do it in an hour, Sam thought\u2026if only he could move. Dean came into his line of sight again and smiled down at him.\n\n\"Hey, Sammy. Twelve more hours or so and you'll be walkin' and talkin' again.\" Dean patted his shoulder and then palmed his forehead worriedly. \"I'm gonna go get some ice and stuff. I'll be back in twenty minutes. Promise.\"\n\nSam wanted to tell him it was alright and take some of the fear from his big brother's eyes but of course, he couldn't. The last time they'd seen this particular curse, the witch who'd used it had done so to save their lives from a leviathan. He'd enjoyed it at the time, relieved to have a harmless leviathan even if only for a few days. It wasn't so funny on the receiving end of the curse. Sam wished he'd ducked faster. If only he hadn't turned his back at the wrong moment, if he hadn't let the witch's twisted disciple stab him\u2026Sam focused his thoughts back on the spot on the ceiling. Thinking of the wound in his side only made it hurt more and he couldn't do anything about it; couldn't even ask for something for the pain. He wanted to groan, or moan or scream. Sam sighed. His breathing and blinking were the only things he did have control of now and had only regained the ability to open and close his eyes in the last day.\n\nThe now familiar panic worked its way into Sam, spinning his thoughts away in a whirlwind because what if this didn't fade? What if he was stuck this way forever? Sam closed his eyes and made himself take a deep breath and then another, trying to find his calm again. He could blink again, Sam reminded himself and that meant the curse was finally weakening and would continue to.\n\n'I'm not trapped.' Sam said in the confines of his mind. 'I'm safe. This will pass.'\n\n\"Hey, buddy. Take it easy.\"\n\nSam wrenched his eyes open with Dean's voice and realized he must have been thinking far too hard for far too long. He focused on Dean's concerned green eyes and let his breathing slow.\n\n\"That's better. I'm gonna sit you up a little here.\" Dean told him calmly and Sam inwardly cheered.\n\nHe'd gotten tired of looking at the crack in the ceiling. Sam's eyes slowly tracked Dean moving away again and then back. He felt like an infant when Dean pried his mouth open and felt two tablets land on his tongue then his big brother wrapped a hand around the back of his head, tipping it for him and put a water bottle to his lips, letting a small amount trickle in before closing Sam's mouth.\n\n\"All you gotta do is swallow.\" Dean coached gently.\n\nSam felt Dean rubbing a hand on his throat, trying to convince his body to do what it needed and a moment later he did swallow. Sam exhaled noisily with relief and took comfort in the hand Dean kept on the back of his neck. Dean had tried to give him a drink the day before but Sam had still had no control and it had come close to choking him. His only consolation was the understanding fear on Dean's face as his brother had held him up until his breathing eased.\n\n\"That went better than last time.\" Dean smirked and reached to his bed, taking the pillow and shoved it behind Sam's back to prop him up. \"Painkillers. How good's your blinking now?\"\n\nSam watched Dean's eyes and blinked slowly twice in response.\n\n\"Nice. So, we're gonna Star Trek this. One blink for yes and two for no.\" Dean grinned. \"Still in pain?\" He nodded when Sam blinked once."}

In an old post, On Dialectical Materialism , I attempted to provide a simple primer, short and to the point, of what it meant to use dialectical logic as a historical materialist. \u00a0And while it may indeed be a fact that \"dialectical materialism\", which has a curious history of being short-handed as \"diamat\", is a term that was not used by Marx or Engels\u2013\u2013prompting some of my readers to complain, at the time that piece was written, that I was using \"Stalinist\" terminology\u2013\u2013this is simply a semantic problem. \u00a0Marx and Engels spoke of doing dialectics as materialists, other writers outside of the \"Stalinist\" tradition (including Trotsky) used the term \"materialist dialectics\" and so I see no problem to relinquish the most popularized term of Marx and Engels' philosophical method. \u00a0Whatever the case, semantic quibbles aside, the main reason I wrote that piece is due to what I saw as a deficiency in some marxist critiques, as well as anti-capitalist critiques in general, of the current conjuncture. \u00a0The implicit argument hidden behind my summary of dialectical materialism was that the absence of dialectical thinking amongst broad sectors of the left demonstrated a deficiency in thought. \u00a0The fact that some marxists were wont to use the name \u00a0of \"dialectics\" without any apparent fidelity to the concept \u00a0was perfect proof of this deficiency: the logical tools behind the science of historical materialism were either being abandoned or misused.\ndialectical logic is essentially the \"unity of opposites\" Of course, there are trajectories of thought that want to reject dialectics altogether. \u00a0I'm not speaking of the traditionally right-wing rejection of dialectics\u2013\u2013the snooty anti-intellectual arch-conservativism that, especially during the cold war, liked to mock dialectics (without understanding it in any real detail) as some sort of sophistic tool that communists used to escape logic\u2013\u2013but of radically anti-capitalist theoretical tendencies. \u00a0Post-modernism saw it as a totalizing logic, a product of a modernity that was intrinsically bound up with murderous conquest and cultural imperialism. \u00a0Analytic Marxism saw it as illogical, Hegelian nonsense that Marx and Engels were better off without. \u00a0Then there are those thinkers, such as Deleuze and Guattari, who would advocate other and more eclectic methods of logic that they assumed better fit the marxist project of emancipation (i.e. the \"rhizome\"). \u00a0Perhaps these rejections of dialectical thoughts are helped along by all of the nonsensical uses of dialectical thinking that have been the pit-falls of innumerable marxist organizations\u2013\u2013after all, if your experience of people who claim to be dialecticians is an experience of people who defend their nonsense as \"dialectical\" then it makes sense to despise the concept. Take, for example, the bizarre claim tendered by more than one marxist organization or individual that dialectical materialism (or, to escape the trap of this terminology, \"materialist dialectics\") is some sort of queen of the sciences . \u00a0Such a claim follows from the older claim that philosophy is the queen of the sciences : for if we agree that philosophy is, as your average Platonist would have it, the queen of the sciences, and that marxism is the pre-eminent science, then it follows that the philosophy of marxism, dialectical materialism, is the \u00a0queen of the sciences. \u00a0Such an assumption, based on the faulty premise of a unifying scientific monarch, has led more than one marxist organization to imagine that they can comment with authority on all scientific disciplines and see themselves as more equipped to explain the meaning of these disciplines than those who have actually bothered to study them. \u00a0Here we have marxists believing, through the ultimate science of dialectics, that they know more about quantum physics and pure mathematics than trained physicists and mathematicians. And though we would not like physicists and mathematicians intervening as authorities, based on their expertise in physics and mathematics, on the field of historical materialism (and indeed more than"}

But that day in June, word spread rapidly over that land of 11 time-zones: Thank Jawaharlal Nehru! The prime minister of India was then visiting the Soviet Union, and he became an instant \u2013 an unwitting \u2013 hero for young Soviet men and women. For many of them, now in their 70s and 80s, he remains a sentimental memory.\n\nThe story told around the country, but never officially reported, went like this: Among the numerous showcases of socialist progress to which the Soviet leaders took Nehru, the giant central park in Moscow was one. The leader of the Soviet Union, Nikita S. Khrushchev, his second-in-command, Prime Minister Nikolai A. Bulganin, and a host of lesser lights, including the mayor of Moscow, accompanied Nehru to the grand entrance to the central park. Nehru suddenly noticed something his hosts had never paid attention to and had taken for granted: a long line of people queuing at the ticket boxes near the gates. This was the scene one would expect to see at a sports stadium on the day of a major game, not at the entrance to a public park on an average day. Curious, Nehru asked who those people were, and why they were queuing. His hosts told him that they were purchasing tickets from cashiers to enter the park. Nehru, it is believed, was dumbfounded. He asked again to be sure, and received the same response.\n\nThe exact words uttered by Nehru are thought to have ranged from astonishment to admonition. He inquired how a communist government of a socialist country could charge its people to enter public parks, while the British, the US and other capitalist countries made public parks open to the public free of charge. The Royal Parks of London had been free public parks since 1851, a century before this Moscow encounter. Khrushchev was profoundly embarrassed, and livid. His retinue could not understand what had gone wrong and looked at their boss for instructions. He said something to his minions, who ran to the ticket boxes yelling and waving hands.\n\nThe ticket boxes were closed immediately, and the crowd was told that entrance was free. A minor stampede occurred when the people already inside ran back to demand refunds. Overnight, telephone calls and telegrams were fired across the Soviet Union. In the morning, the radio announcers informed the Soviet people that all public parks were free. In many parks, the surrounding metal fences were removed and the gates stood open even at night. That was a social revolution.\n\nWhy were there entrance fees in the first place? Most likely, it was a fiscal matter of municipal budget revenues. Soviet municipal governments, which had to take care of underpriced public utilities and the repair of the aging housing stock, were starved for revenues. Public parks entrance fees were handy \u2013 especially since rapid urbanisation had increased the number of paying customers. But once these fees had been exposed as unbecoming of a socialist country, they were doomed.\n\nA great social liberation ensued. More people could afford to use public parks more often for recreation, family pursuits, picnics and romantic exploration. Everyone was elated and grateful to Nehru, the young and the old, the athletes and the war invalids, the picnicking families and the dating singles. Especially the latter. It so happened that in the Soviet Union, public parks doubled as open-air dance venues and dating spots, for the lack of other options. People had had to pay twice, once for the park entrance and again \u2013 the same amount \u2013 for the dance enclosure. Now, thanks to Nehru, the price had halved.\n\nThis was a huge deal, especially for students, young workers and apprentices. In the early and mid-1950s, urban social life was constrained. There were very few opportunities for young people to meet and date. Restaurants were beyond reach. A restaurant meal cost about 10% of the monthly wage per person. People ate at cheap factory cafeterias and municipal diners, which were not quite romantic. People lived in barracks and crammed communal flats, several persons to a room, often a dozen or more per apartment. Young people gathered in the backyards and basements of buildings \u2013 shabby, murky places. There were, in each city, a few factory clubs and community centers where people could dance; but it was assumed, with good reason, that the management was watching.\n\nAfter Nehru, dancing in urban parks became more affordable. Strangers could meet more easily. The dating pool became greater and more heter"}

The play features the talents of Quincy Jones, a samurai, and, of course, a black Jesus, all while instigating conflict within the placid suburb of Woodcrest. It might have been fair to assume that Black Jesus would produce similar levels of uproar. Instead, even Bill Donahue was cool with it\u2014the worst thing the president of the Catholic League had to say about the show was that its version of Jesus was a \"mixed bag.\"\n\nAnd that's a pretty fair critical assessment of Black Jesus. At the end of its first season, it's basically a low-key, ideologically family-friendly sitcom with a bit more plot and a lot more cursing and weed. This version of Jesus, as played by Gerald \"Slink\" Johnson, is just a nice dude who wants everyone to be a little nicer to each other, and to themselves (and maybe also give him the last hit on the blunt). If Jesus Christ, Our Lord And Savior returned to Earth and decided to just kick it with his homies and do good work in his community, so what?\n\nJohnson's easygoing energy does a lot to anchor the other characters surrounding Jesus, who are all pretty basic archetypes otherwise\u2014Boonie the lazy loser (Corey Holcomb), Trayvon the nerd (Andrew Bachelor), Maggie the social media-obsessed gossip (Kali Hawk), and Fish the ex-con (Andra Fuller). Almost all of the actors have decent comic chops, and their characters deepen just enough over the course of the season to justify a little emotional investment. But the crucial players in this cast are the villains. Charlie Murphy and John Witherspoon are both hilariously grumpy and acerbic as Vic the landlord and Lloyd the bum, respectively, and McGruder accordingly forces them into increasingly close proximity. (A late-season reference to Vic and Lloyd as The Odd Couple reads like a cruel tease of what the show might have been.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThough the first episode serves primarily to introduce Jesus and his crew, the rest of the season explores a single, ongoing plot about their attempt to start a community garden in Compton (to help their neighbors and also grow weed). The obstacles to getting the garden up and running are increasingly ridiculous, but they mostly serve to provide a reason for the cast to get slightly worked up\u2014the back half of the season is surprisingly successful in establishing the show's vibe, but the finale's attempt to seriously raise the stakes and bring the story to a climax just feels out of place and forced by comparison.\n\nIn fact, even with longer-term plots, Black Jesus is so casual that it sometimes feels as if the show is deploying a sitcom reset button at the end of every episode (or at least the episodes sometimes blur together). That makes sense, since classic sitcoms often read as the biggest influence on the series (there's literally a \"let's put on a show\" episode), particularly in Mike Clattenburg's direction, which somehow injects a goofy, borderline Looney Tunes-like energy into the proceedings while remaining decidedly unhurried.\n\nBlack Jesus' reliance on some of those tropes allows the show to simply run a lot of standard Christian iconography through a mashup of Pineapple Express and Good Times. Though Vic questions whether Jesus is who he says he is, the show never really threatens to explore this rather dark possibility, and never suggests that \"Pops\" doesn't have a master plan for everyone. Thankfully, as much as McGruder and Clattenburg buy into the ideas of Jesus, that master plan does not include full-on biblical retelling or Boondocks-style political humor. Far from radical, this is a late-period Common or Talib Kweli album: It'll make you feel good for a while if you like what it's selling, but it's certainly not making any big statements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBesides, nothing ever really feels important enough to get anyone on this show to put their joint down, let alone protest. For the most part, Black Jesus is a pleasant, relatively mindless high, and like an eager-to-please stoner, it's generally fun to hang out with for 20 minutes at a time. In \"A Huey Freeman Christmas,\" The Adventures Of Black Jesus play only goes forward because of Mr. Uberwitz, an \"irresponsible white person\" whose unthinkingly reactive liberal politics"}

The former Muslim woman had converted to Christianity and was involved in a project to help refugees run by her community church in Prien am Chiemsee in Bavaria. None of her friends had ever thought it possible that the woman would be stabbed by a 29-year-old refugee, also from Afghanistan, on the street in front of her children's eyes.\n\nPolice were initially cautious regarding the motive of the crime. The attacker was considered to be \"mentally unstable\" and is undergoing psychiatric treatment, but the investigators are also considering the woman's conversion into a different religion as a possible motive. After all, the suspected murderer had been described as \"very religious.\"\n\nMuslims distance themselves from the crime\n\nAs investigations progress, the victim's funeral (pictured above) took place on Wednesday. At the funeral service, the community pastor spoke about the reactions triggered by the crime. Speaking to DW, Karl-Friedrich Wackerbath said that Muslims turned up spontaneously and excused themselves for what had happened. They also expressed hope that the incident would not again lead to a general smear campaign against Muslims.\n\nEven though clerics from their home countries shared different convictions, Muslims in Germany would not threaten to kill anyone who converted from Islam to Christianity. \"The danger however, is that a wedge is being driven between our cultures and religions.\"\n\nRefugee victims feel helpless\n\nA case of discrimination\n\nEveryday life in a refugee shelter is different. Since 2015, there has been an increase in the number of reports about Christians among refugees who have been verbally or physically attacked. Although the situation has eased with a lesser number of refugees coming to Germany, there are still some embarrassing situations for converts among the asylum seekers.\n\nVictims feel helpless because they are not taken seriously\n\nFor example, a graffiti on one of the victims' walls reads, \"It is time to kill the non-believers.\" Entry to the bathroom, showers or the kitchen has been restricted with the words, \"The impure cannot enter,\" written on the doors. Converts are made to hear Islamic prayers or verses from the Quran, played through mobile phones. Those not wearing headscarves or openly wearing crosses are subject to harsh accusations. Apart from insults and abuses, there are knife attacks, and every now and then, death threats.\n\nRepresentatives of church organizations helping refugees told DW that such incidents occur quite often. The \"Iraner Seelsorge\" in Hannover, which counsels refugees from Iran, reported a case in which a young convert was bullied at school for so long that he had to leave it. At the Evangelical-Lutheran-Trinity community in Berlin's Steglitz area, Pastor Gottfried Martens complains that victims reporting such cases were not taken seriously.\n\nLast year, the head of the German Bishops' Conference, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, as well as the Evangelical Church in Germany's Heinrich-Bedford Strohm admitted to cases of intimidation and violence against Christian refugees. One was taking it seriously, but did not yet have a clear picture of the extent of the religious conflict. The basic idea of the churches was that these were isolated incidents which were causing worry.\n\nOnly the tip of the iceberg?\n\nPastor Gottfried Martens helps refugees from Iran and Afghanistan\n\n\"The isolated case theory has been disproved,\" said Ado Greve in a conversation with DW. Greve is a spokesman for the non-denominational Christian charity \"Open Doors\" in Kelkheim, a suburb of Frankfurt. The organization attempts to give a voice to Christian minorities around the world. No one had ever expected Germany to have a role to play in this. When complaints about the discrimination of Christian refugees wouldn't stop, Open Doors decided to get some figures on its own. The first attempt was publicly criticized because of supposedly unreliable data. But on October 2016, the organization followed up with a second publication. \"Fifty-six percent spoke about physical attacks and 83 percent of those who we questioned admitted that they were attacked several times,\" Ado Greve said.\n\nWhen pointed out that this information was based only on 750 conversations, Greve responded with a counter question: \"How many affected refugees do we need so we do not treat these as isolated cases anymore? Five hundred? One thousand?\" This is a pointless and also a humiliating discussion. Every case is one too many. One did not also claim at any point in time that this was a representative survey. It is also not relevant how bad the attacks would be. Even a death threat can do enormous damage to the person. Because in the countries, where the attackers and their victims come from, the threats are often followed by deeds.\n\nThe Christian asylum seekers questioned by Open Doors came mostly from Iran (304), from Syria (263) and Afghanistan (63). The attackers were people from their own countries and also"}

Google on Tuesday announced a new pair of flagship phones, the 5-inch Pixel and 5.5-inch Pixel XL, and proclaimed that, this time, for real, it's serious about selling smartphone hardware. To that end, it positioned the new devices as high-end phones with appropriately high-end prices: $649 and $769, respectively.\n\nAs this chart from Statista shows, though, this isn't the first time Google has dabbled with premium hardware. While it's true that most Nexus phones were pitched as affordable and \"good enough,\" 2014's Nexus 6 and 2011's Galaxy Nexus (initially, at least) started at the same $649 price tag as the standard Pixel. Perhaps not coincidentally, both of those were sold through Verizon as well.\n\nYes, the Pixel is not the Nexus. The software is more customized, and Google has reportedly been more hands-on in the development process. But it still isn't making the phones (HTC is), and the benefits of owning them (fast updates) will be similar to before. Really, the biggest difference here seems to be marketing \u2014 Google has gone all out to make these look like its own smartphones. Time will tell if that's enough to help Pixel succeed where Nexus faltered."}

After taste is a bit burnt, bit oaky \u2013 I imagine this is from the bourbon barrel. All in all a very nice flavour to mix or chuck down straight.\n\n5 As with any whiskey in the world, some will hate it, some will love it. Me, I have enjoyed Scotch for most of my adult life. Highlands single malt is my favorite! Blended scotch is something you put in your car radiator! Haig Club, in my opinion, is an excellent, smooth, single grain Scotch. I am sure that many will argue this and many will agree. Try it yourself and then decide!\n\n3 Having read all the bad reviews below, I was dreading my first taste and second guessing my decision to buy this reduced whisky. I'm pleased to report that l loved it. I'm no expert but often find myself wondering what all the fuss is about over single malt as I've as enjoyed scotch more. If you're the same I would description be it as a lighter version of famous grouse which I love but this could well become my new favourite and you get a lovely blue bottle. Good luck\n\n1 Really nasty. I bought this from Tesco on offer, I liked the bottle and thought I'd seen it somewhere... when I got home I remembered I'd seen Beckham advertising it, which probably wasn't a good sign but I'd bought it and thought I'd give it a go. I couldn't finish the glass. I had two sips but it is aggressively unpleasant. I like whisky, though I prefer smooth Highland single malts to the very peaty Islay malts. This stuff is undrinkable, it didn't even taste like whisky, it smells of turps and tastes thin and acrid, like some sort of chemical waste. Don't waste your money, I'll be pouring the rest away - might keep the nice blue bottle though!\n\n4 Excellent whisky. Very drinkable. Goes down easy like a light Japanese whiskey. Bit pricey though. There are better whiskys for a similar price.\n\n1 It's like watered down cheap supermarket brand whiskey. I feel like I've been robbed by the shop I got it from. A least Dick Turpin had the decency to wear a mask.\n\n5 One of the best whisky's I've ever tasted\n\n5 It's nice. Drinkable and enjoyable and smooth. Better than most of the overpriced 10yr single malts by far.\n\n2 I found the taste watery and insipid. It's too tasteless with no character.\n\n1 Cheap and awful whiskey\n\n5 Always avoided it, never been a fan of Beckham, no offence, but full credit to the man, just had my first doppy from a gift bottle and it's nice and smooth, good taste and I'll raise the next one you dad, cheers bud, you'd have enjoyed this one.\n\n4 I don't really get all the negatives here. It is what it is. A really subtle drink. Agreed no depth but really smooth. It's an easy evening drink. My palette is in favour of the smoky peaty drinks but love this as a smooth alternative.\n\n1 Thin, weak, cheap, basic.\n\n1 Truly awful whisky. There is absolutely no depth of flavour and it is unpleasant to drink. Would be passable as a cheap mixer, but ridiculously overpriced. I have had some fun giving a taste to friends to see their reaction (meaning that I don't have to drink as much of it myself). All who have tried it so far agree that it is terrible. It is a shame the quality of the whisky is so bad, because the packaging and bottle look great.\n\n1 Absolute crap! If you put one ounce in a 12 ounce can of coke, it might become drinkable. I'm giving it zero stars, but I had to choose one to get my review posted.\n\n2 Very sweet flavour like cream soda, and light in colour. Made the younger market who wouldn't usually drink whisky. It's the alcopop of the whisky world. It's not to my taste, but not so bad that I won't finish the bottle eventually.\n\n1 Extremely over priced and poor quality. It's really a shame that a lot of people are tricked into buying it as a gift due to the flash packaging and marketing campaign when there are so many other more fantastic bottles out there for the same price or cheaper. This is a cheap nasty 3 year old spirit, lacking any refinement, in a fancy bottle\n\n1 Terrible, just terrible. it has a horrible burning sensation and not in a good way. If you want the nice bottle then definitely go for it. If you want a quality Whisky avoid for similar pricing you can have a 10 year Laphroaig.\n"}

Breathless accounts of a new crime wave have appeared in both liberal and conservative media. Right-wing pundits and some police leaders have claimed that there is a \"Ferguson effect\"\u2014a significant crime increase due to the \"Black Lives Matter\" protests against police violence. This is both junk science and political opportunism. Ad Policy The \"Ferguson Effect\" is both junk science and political opportunism.\n\nThe New York Times recently reported that a couple dozen US cities have experienced increases in murders, and a few others some increase in other violent crimes. While any uptick in serious crime should be of concern, short-term changes in a few crime categories is thin evidence of a sustained national trend. In fact, in most parts of the country, crime in general, and murder rates in particular, continue to go down. While New York City, one site of ongoing protest, had a spike in homicides in the early part of the year, the city just completed the \"safest summer in 25 years\" according to Commissioner Bill Bratton. In addition, a new report by the Sentencing Project shows that in St. Louis, the uptick in homicides actually was well underway before the death of Michael Brown.\n\nEven in cities that have experienced some increase in homicides, there has been no increase in other crimes. Why would a reduction in policing (as claimed by proponents of the \"Ferguson effect\") result in more homicides but fewer robberies, burglaries, and auto thefts? The fact is that while homicide numbers are considered very accurate, they are such rare occurrences that it is very dangerous to draw any conclusions about broader crime trends from limited periods of time. Six months of homicide data is not enough to predict what year-end numbers will look like, and it's bad journalism and worse science to do so.\n\nFor the last 20 years, police leaders and their supporters have claimed near-total credit for the dramatic drop in crime beginning in the 1990s, even though different police departments have supported very different and at times contradictory methods. Now that there is some evidence of a crime increase in their jurisdiction, their fingers are suddenly pointing elsewhere. The right-wing echo chamber is abuzz with attacks on the movement against police misconduct, from slandering individual activists to blaming a host of social ills on them, while at the same time denying that they have any influence or relevance. The uptick in homicides in St. Louis was well underway before the death of Michael Brown."}

The labels are voluntary, according to the Associated Press.\n\nThe labels will include information such as calories, servings per container, serving size and carbohydrates. Some alcohol companies want to use the labels to display low calories and carbohydrates. Beer companies may be less likely to use them, because they don't want to emphasize how many calories their products have, the article notes. Some winemakers won't want the labels to detract from the appearance of their bottles.\n\nMichael Jacobson, Director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said alcohol manufacturers should be required to list alcohol contents on the label. He said in a statement, \"Including fat and carbohydrates on a label could imply that an alcoholic beverage is positively healthful, especially when the drink's alcohol content isn't prominently labeled. In this era of obesity, calorie labeling is critically important to inform or remind consumers that alcoholic drinks are not 'free' when it comes to calories. Finally, a really useful alcohol label would state the government's definition of moderate drinking as no more than one drink per day for women or two drinks per day for men.\"\n\nCurrently, alcohol makers do not have to list ingredients on the label, but they must list substances a person could be sensitive to, such as sulfites, aspartame and certain food colorings."}

Or trying to get pregnant, only to get the positive test and lose the baby before you got too far into it. Infertility sucks. Plain and simple and when you're struggling with infertility, one of the most challenging aspects is dealing with other women's pregnancy. It's incredibly hard when a close friend or family member becomes pregnant, especially if it wasn't hard for her to conceive, and then to have to worry about why life isn't fair because you're still waiting, fighting, and hurting.\n\nThe feelings are complicated because you're happy for your friend, because pregnancy news is often really happy news, but you're also hurting for you. Because for real, why isn't it always so 'easy'?\n\nIt sucks when you're struggling and it's hard to not fall down that \"why not me\" spiral that can suck you in when you're angry and frustrated. And then you feel bad that their happy news makes you angry. It's complicated, it's painful and it can ruin relationships.\n\nInfertility really took a toll on me. After 12 miscarriages, and 18+ months of trying to get pregnant with another child who I would be able to bring home, love on, and actually get to know, I was tired of it. I was done with the endless struggle and the last thing I wanted was to see another friend announce, go through the 9+ months and get to meet their baby \u2026 all while I was still in this hole that I couldn't get out of.\n\n{Also read: 3 Ways We Can Do Better for Our Friend Who Had a Miscarriage}\n\nPregnancy announcements from others and infertility don't mix, to put it lightly. It's like oil and water, but with more complications because all our lives we're told to be a good friend, we have to put aside our own feelings, but that's not easy \u2014 nor should it be required \u2014 when you're in this dynamic.\n\nWhen you're struggling with infertility and not able to avoid pregnancy announcements, there are some ways you can both guard your heart from the pain and sorrow, and help to preserve relationships that are important to you. It starts with allowing yourself to feel what you need to feel \u2014 the good, bad, angry, ugly, complicated, and everywhere in between.\n\nLet me remind you that you should not feel guilt over your legitimate feelings. You're allowed to feel the complications, the pain, the ANGER, the frustration, and you should be kind to yourself and give you that space.\n\nYou can also set up boundaries with your pregnant friend, immediately, so you can give yourself that comfort and self-care that you need.\n\nYou might not want to listen to them talk about how easy it was to get pregnant or if they're still making a decision on whether they're going to keep the baby. Maybe you don't want to listen to them complain about feeling sick or pregnancy aches and pains. Even if you just don't have it in you emotionally right now, you're allowed that space.\n\nOr if you need to take a \"break\" from them for a while, that's allowed, too.\n\nIt is OK and healthy to put those boundaries up with your friend and they should respect it. You can choose when or if you want to be involved in their life while they're pregnant and hopefully at the same time you'll have a group of people around you who will support you, and love you through infertility.\n\nDo you have any advice for a friend who is battling infertility and they're facing some pregnancy news that aches, even though they're happy?

It has the ability to dispel demonic forces and grant protection against such forces to those who use the item.\n\nFirst seen in Silent Hill, it also plays a role in Silent Hill 3. Aglaophotis plays an important role in both games, as its use in the first game heavily affects what ending the player will receive.\n\nContents show]\n\nDescription\n\nA memo in Silent Hill 3 gives a brief description of Aglaophotis.\n\nAglaophotis Red liquid or crystals resembling blood. According to the Kabbalah, the name is taken from an herb with the power to dispel evil spirits. It is said to grow in Arabian deserts.\n\nIt may be vaporized or applied as a poultice to guard against demons.

How he obtained them is unknown, though it seems likely from a later conversation with Dahlia Gillespie that Kaufmann was holding onto the substance in the event that Dahlia's plans went in a direction he didn't like.\n\nAs Harry Mason explores the town of Silent Hill looking for clues as to the whereabouts of his daughter Cheryl, he comes across Alchemilla Hospital. While searching the hospital, Harry finds a broken bottle of Aglaophotis (then unknown) on the floor in Kaufmann's office. Harry can take the empty plastic bottle from the nearby kitchen and collect a sample and use it to save Cybil Bennett when she is found possessed by a parasite in the merry-go-round at the Lakeside Amusement Park.\n\nHarry can continue investigating Kaufmann's involvement and the Aglaophotis in the Resort Area of Silent Hill. Before reaching the boathouse to meet Cybil, Harry can enter Annie's Bar and save Dr. Kaufmann from an attacking monster. Further investigation of Kaufmann's tracks leads to the discovery of a vial of Aglaophotis hidden in Kaufmann's motorcycle.\n\nIf Harry saves Kaufmann, he will appear during Harry's final confrontation with Dahlia in a place known as Nowhere. After Alessa Gillespie is brought to her true form, Kaufmann will appear to intercept Dahlia's plans. He proceeds to shoot Dahlia, then takes the vial of Aglaophotis previously hidden in the motorcycle and hurls it at the combined form of Alessa and Cheryl Mason. The vial breaks and coats the entity in the fluid. Through the Aglaophotis's exorcising power, the \"god\" imbued within Alessa is forced out as the Incubus, a creature created from Dahlia's vision of God.\n\nSilent Hill 3\n\nHeather Mason, the reborn identity of Alessa Gillespie and Cheryl Mason, was given a necklace by her father Harry as a child. Containing a red jewel, it is revealed that the crystal is actually a small capsule of Aglaophotis.\n\nHow he procured the sample is unknown.

We all saw that in 2008 in the West.\n\nTwo minutes googling Chinese business scandals and it's hard to argue that this is not a huge problem long term for China. China wants to get past this so it is clamping down rather than risk a monumental meltdown a few years down the line.\n\nRight now, this China credit crunch means a lot of people need to pull money out of the global markets to bring home to traditionally settle their year-end books.

The results suggest that it is difficult to establish a robust causal relationship between financial integration and economic growth. Furthermore, there is little evidence that developing countries have been consistently successful in using financial integration to stabilize fluctuations in consumption growth. However, we do find that financial globalization can be beneficial under the right circumstances. Empirically, good institutions and quality of governance are crucial in helping developing countries derive the benefits of globalization. Similarly, macroeconomic stability appears to be an important prerequisite for ensuring that financial globalization is beneficial for developing countries. Finally, countries that employ relatively flexible exchange rate regimes and succeed in maintaining fiscal discipline are more likely to enjoy the potential growth and stabilization benefits of financial globalization.\n\nMachine-readable bibliographic record - MARC, RIS, BibTeX\n\nDocument Object Identifier (DOI): 10.3386/w10942\n\nPublished: Financial Globalization, Growth and Volatility in Developing Countries, Eswar S.

Will Clinton send hers next?\n\nThe Clinton campaign confirmed they had received a letter from Pe\u00f1a Nieto but did not give further details on a potential meeting.\n\n\"Secretary Clinton last met with President Pe\u00f1a Nieto in Mexico in 2014 and our campaign is in a regular dialogue with Mexican government officials. She looks forward to talking with President Pe\u00f1a Nieto again at the appropriate time,\" a Clinton aide told Fusion in an email when asked if the Democratic candidate would also make the trip south.\n\nFor now it's unclear if the \"appropriate time\" will come during or after the campaign. Instead the Clinton camp is criticizing Trump's performance in Mexico.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Donald Trump has made his outlandish policy of forcing Mexico to pay for his giant wall the centerpiece of his campaign. But at the first opportunity to make good on his offensive campaign promises, Trump choked,\" said Clinton campaign chair John Podesta in a press release. \"What we saw today from a man who claims to be the ultimate 'deal maker' is that he doesn't have the courage to advocate for his campaign promises when he's not in front of a friendly crowd.\"\n\nBut would Clinton benefit from visiting the Mexican president during her campaign?\n\nPe\u00f1a Nieto probably would. If Clinton did decide to go it would help the Mexican president justify his meeting with Trump by showing that his invitation was in fact about opening a dialogue with both candidates, and not just a failed attempt to mollify Trump's hardline stance on immigration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it's unclear what incentives Clinton would have for making her own quick trip to Mexico. The Democrat already has a big lead in the polls with Latinos voters in the U.S., and has the support of Mexicans in Mexico by virtue of being Trump's opponent.\n\nPlus, Clinton doesn't have to prove that she can act diplomatic or presidential. As secretary of state she's met many world leaders already. A handshake with Pe\u00f1a Nieto, an unpopular president tied to a series of security and corruption scandals in Mexico, isn't exactly the boost Clinton is looking for right now.\n\nThe press could also give Clinton trouble if she goes to Mexico. The media might ask her about corruption scandals in Mexico, the flow of firearms across the border, the NAFTA free-trade agreement signed by her husband, the U.S.' position on the disappearance of the 43 students from Ayotzinapa, or the pending extradition of drug lord Chapo Guzm\u00e1n. Any words that she utters on any of those touchy issues in Mexico would provide fodder for media headlines for days\u2014and not necessarily the type Clinton wants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nClinton, as Secretary of State, showed signs that she understood the importance of Mexico as a partner to the U.S. But a trip to Mexico right now would involve many risks and few returns.

This column takes a satirical look at some of the main movements in psychology by asking each to answer the following question:\n\n\nWhy do people play the bass?\n\n\nFreudian Psychoanalysis. The individual plays the bass due to subconscious sexual and aggressive drives. The bass is a phallic symbol that masks the anxiety that resulted from the (male) bassist's fear as a young child that his father would castrate him because of his amorous feelings towards his mother. For the female bassist, the bass compensates for penis envy.\n\n\nAdlerian Psychoanalysis . Playing the bass is a way of overcoming feelings of inferiority caused in the childhood.\n\n\nBehaviourism . The individual has no choice whether or not he or she wants to play the bass. He or she has been conditioned to do so and therefore does it.\n\n\nCognitive psychology . Playing the bass is the result of an intricate network of inherent and learnt information processing mechanisms. The individual takes into account a wide variety of information and then makes the decision to play the bass.\n\n\nHumanistic psychology . Individuals play the bass in their process of becoming a whole and mature being. Playing the bass helps him or her to fulfil needs for self-actualisation, fulfil his or her potential, and have peak experiences. Thus, the bass helps the player to grow and develop as a unique human being.\n\n\nExistential psychology. Playing the bass is the individual's choice, an expression of his or her complete individual freedom. However, this freedom also makes it his or her responsibility to play the bass. Finally, It also helps the individual to cope with the fact that he or she will inevitably die.\n\n\nPhysiological psychology . Playing the bass is the result of the interactions among brain structures and chemical and electric impulses stimulated in the brain.\n\n\nAbnormal psychology . The voices make them do it.\n\n\nLogotherapy . The individual plays the bass because he or she finds meaning in it. Without that meaning, life is a deep dark pit of despair. Thus, the bass saves the individual from committing suicide and helps him or her to transcend everyday life towards an ultimate meaning.\n\n\nEvolutionary psychology . The bassist (Homo Bassist Superior) is the result of many millennia of evolution from the species Homo Inferior Drummer and Homo Neanderthal Guitarist. The principle of natural selection states that only the strong survive, which guarantees the continued existence of this rare breed.\n\n\nPhenomenological psychology . We can only understand why the individual plays the bass by asking him or her. There is no universal reason or subjective truth that says why people play the bass - every individual is unique.\n\n\nExperimental psychology . To answer that question, we will draw a representative sample from the population of bass players and divide it into two equal groups. One group will receive an intervention, the other won't. Thereafter, we will use advanced statistical procedures to determine if the groups are significantly different. If they are, then we know that people play the bass because of the experimental effect. If they are not, you messed up the experiment.\n\n\nFeminist psychology . Men play the bass because it is an instrument through which they can maintain the patriarchal status quo of society and thus keep suppressing women. To correct this inequality, the bass has to change fundamentally. Women have to break the glass ceiling and take what is rightfully theirs \u2013 the bass.\n\n\nDevelopmental psychology . Someone plays the bass because of the stage of development, or critical life stage, he or she is in. Playing the bass is a critical event in itself, which causes changes in the individual's personality.\n\n\nSocial psychology. Playing the bass is the result of the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others. In other words, they made me do it (this fits people who play the bass because everyone else in the band told them to).\n\n\nSocial constructionist psychology . We can't be sure that they are playing the bass. The bass has been socially constructed through language and is thus only played if people say they do. We never ask why.\n\n\nCommunity psychology. The question is not why people play the bass. The question is how can we help everyone to own a bass?\n\n\nPop psychology . If you really want to know the answer to the question, look deep inside yourself, and then buy my book, \"Why the bass? A guide to self-improvement\" for only R99995 (VAT and P&P excl.). If you call now, you will get five cents off the delivery costs! That's right: FIVE CENTS!\n\n\nIndustrial/organisational psychology . Did someone say play? Get back to work!\n\n\nNow, next time people ask you why you play that thingie with the four strings and not a real instrument"}
{"id": 259158, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Motivation\n\nThis library aims to make it easy for users to build native apps that work portably across platforms. I'm also very interested in the user interface renaissance in the programming community, whether the various kinds of functional reactive programming, meta-object protocol UIs, or something like React.js. The hope is that a low-cost, hassle-free way of getting a UI up and running without having to deal with browser, authentication, and compilation issues will make it more fun to play around with these great ideas using Haskell. Why a native toolkit? Even in this era of web interfaces, it is still useful to be able to make native apps. They are usually faster and have fewer security issues. Why FLTK? I chose FLTK because it was small enough that one person could bind the whole thing in an initial pass. Larger toolkits like QT, although much slicker, would require many man-years of effort.\n\nFLTK is quite featureful.\n\nFLTK is mature and maintained. The project is about 20 years old, and I have had good experiences with the community.\n\nFLTK comes with a simple but quite useful GUI builder, Fluid which is now able to generate Haskell code. See the `Fluid Support` section for more details. What about HsQML/WxHaskell/Gtk2Hs? These are all great projects and produce really nice UIs, but they all fail at least one of criterion listed under the Goals section below. To my knowledge, as of the second quarter of 2017, no other package in the Haskell ecosystem meets all those constraints.\n\nGoals\n\nThe goals of this library are to provide a low-level API to the FLTK that: provides full coverage of the toolkit allowing the user to write GUIs in pure Haskell. feels like it has polymorphic dispatch, meaning a single function dispatches to the right implementation based on the type of widget it is given. is not monolithic, meaning new widgets can be incorporated the user's application without needing to recompile this library. is easy to install. This library has a minimum of dependencies and FLTK itself compiles cleanly on most architectures. And now there is a bundled option where Cabal/Stack build FLTK for you behind the scenes. allows the user to produce statically linked binaries with a minimum of external dependencies. includes a lot of complete working demos so that you can get up and running faster. comes with GUI builder support to alleviate the tedium of laying out widgets by hand.\n\nObstacles\n\nThis section attempts to briefly highlight some possible dealbreakers users might want to know about before proceeding. To be clear, building and deploying portable static application binaries works well on all platforms which is why the library is considered usable. And most of these issues are being aggressively addressed but in the interests of full disclosure ... Look & Feel The default look of FLTK apps can be charitably described as retro. And FLTK has no support for theming since it was designed for the embedded domain and trades off slickness for speed, portability and binary size. But that doesn't mean the user is limited to the default! FLTK is quite flexible and it is pretty easy to change the way a widget looks and behaves, but there is no \"theme file\" that applies uniformly to all widgets in the app. Compile Times Currently a dense app with ~ 160-180 widgets crammed into the same window takes 9-12 seconds to compile with GHC 7.10.3 on a 32GB quad-core machine. The good news is that this is a known issue.\n\nInstallation\n\nThere are two ways to install FLTKHS, building with the bundled FLTK GUI library, or compiling and installing FLTK from scratch yourself. The bundled way is by far the easiest on all platforms. It is completely self-contained, you don't need any sudo access to your system.\n\nBuild With Bundled FLTK\n\nLinux & *BSD\n\nThe steps are: Make sure to have OpenGL installed if you need it.\n\nEnsure that make , autoconf and autoheader are available on your system.\n\n, and are available on your system. Download & install Stack.\n\nDownload & install the FLTKHS hello world skeleton.\n\nVerify the install by running `fltkhs-hello-world`.

The image of young women toiling for hours in dark, sweltering conditions for companies apparently averse to the diversion of even the smallest slice of their profits towards safety measures that could save the lives of their employees is a powerful one, and has placed great pressure on the Cambodian government to act in pursuit of an acceptable minimum wage.\n\nWhat such reports invariably underplay, however, is the far more intractable reality that starts just meters away, beyond the factory walls. Impressive though the figures on the Cambodian garment industry are \u2013 400, 000 garment workers from a total population of around 15,000,000 is an oft quoted statistic \u2013 they tell only a fraction of the story of migration in Cambodia. This \"gentle land,\" characterized as docile and unchanging by visitors from ancient Chinese merchants to their 21st century descendants is now, more than ever, churning with the movement of labor.\n\nAccording to a forthcoming IDRC funded research project, even those migrant enclaves, such as Teuk Thla in the West of Phnom Penh, built in the shadow of a dozen or more garment factories, comprise only around two thirds garment workers, with a litany of other occupations completing the occupational profile. Elsewhere, amongst the half-built skyscrapers of the construction boom, or the silage tanks that filter Phnom Penh's award-winning water supply, the numbers would be expected to be much higher. Almost none of these workers enjoy the security, safety or level of pay received by those who toil in the factories.\n\nTheir alternatives are rarely as salubrious, from the sun baked, back breaking, toil of construction work, where cheap cement torments the skin and scars the lungs, to a place amongst the army of garbage workers who crisscross Phnom Penh's streets at night. For these latter workers, the daily tasks of collection, transportation and sorting are compounded by the shame of a very public engagement with the city's waste. As a garbage depot owner himself admitted: \"Of all the migrant jobs, this is by far the lowliest. When people come to work here I warn them that they will heavily looked down upon but that they must not let this stigma coerce them into anti-social acts such as stealing or it will make things even worse for the others.\"\n\nFor anyone working and living under such conditions to proclaim themselves \"lucky,\" as the vast majority of migrant workers do, tends to strike a dissonant note to Western ears, resolvable only as the indomitable spirit of mankind, unbowed by circumstance. Such words, though, are not expressions of soulful bravery, but statements of numerical fact. They are the lucky ones, as for many times more Cambodians, who lack the connections or money to move, modern sector migrant labor remains an inaccessible cornucopia, far removed from their own, increasingly barren, fields.\n\nSince the turn of the millennium, the Kingdom has suffered at least five of its worst recorded nationwide droughts or floods, alternating with cruel regularity and catastrophic disruption to livelihoods. With record surpassing record in terms of economic damage and popular displacement, evidence is mounting that these extreme events are rooted in the irreversible process of climate change.\n\nAnd yet, even in the throes of this environmental crisis, poverty figures have plummeted during the past two decades. The government, perhaps enchanted more by the myth of Ankorean fertility then the contemporary reality thereof, attributes this to the rising price of rice during the period, expediently setting aside the detail that many of the poorest Cambodians are in fact net consumers of the staple. As a senior source at the Asian Development Bank's Cambodia mission attests, these forgotten poor have been left with only one solution: \"People end up to their eyeballs in debt, taking out more and more loans to survive climate shocks\u2026 People are smoothing their consumption with debt.\"\n\nOnce the preserve only of individual moneylenders, the rise of microcredit has seen the accessibility of debt skyrocket during the past two decades, with recent research from Kandal province indicating that debt as a percentage of annual income has now risen above sixty percent in some rural areas. There and elsewhere, as rural roads have been expanded and improved, brightly colored, air conditioned offices have sprouted alongside them, offering easy money with minimal collateral. For those as yet insufficiently tempted, young men in crisp white shirts ride their brand new company scooters through the villages, collecting repayments and advertising loans. On any given day, debt is rarely more than a whistle and a wave away.\n\nOf course, those unable to survive on their rural incomes without debt are inevitably unable to settle their loans by those same means. Once repayments can no longer be made, the only remaining option is to send whoever is able to the city, with or without guidance, with or without knowledge of"}

In bold black pen, Ju Hyun-woo recounted the week's events: thousands of railway workers dismissed for striking; the suicide of a farmer in protest at the construction of electricity pylons near his village; and the conservative ruling party's proposal to expel an opposition politician for questioning the legitimacy of the president, Park Geun-hye. Mr Ju asked readers: \"How are you all feeling nowadays?\"\n\nAnswers came in thick and fast, and most people said they were not fine. Within a few days dozens of handwritten posters\u2014known as daejabo\u2014were pinned up next to his, on issues ranging from high gas bills to gay rights. Now Mr Ju reckons almost 1,000 have been tacked onto university walls around the country. Students in Japan, America, China and Chile have followed, posting pictures of their posters on the \"Can't be OK\" Facebook page, which gathered 260,000 followers in a week.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\nSocial media have long been a haven for anonymous dissenting voices in South Korea. But Mr Ju says he wanted to \"take responsibility\" for his poster: he signed it and stood in front of it for ten hours, engaging passers-by. Breaking with a tradition of politically charged, militant daejabo, used in the past by Korean students to demand change, Mr Ju left readers to come up with their own grievances\u2014and answers.\n\nThe group's catchphrase, an everyday greeting, has potential to unite not just students but disgruntled workers, housewives and high-school pupils, says Park Mi, the author of a book on Korean student movements. An opposition politician has used it in a daejabo he posted in offices in South Korea's National Assembly, promising to work harder to help those who are \"not fine\". On January 1st a man calling for the president's resignation died after setting himself on fire\u2014a rare form of dissent associated with the heyday of activism in the 1980s against the then military dictator. (Park Geun-hye happens to be the daughter of South Korea's longest-running dictator, killed by his spy chief in 1979.) Police found the man's last diary entry, entitled \"How are you nowadays?\".\n\nThe connection to the 1980s protests has awakened memories of students bringing down regimes. But Park Mi points out that the \"How are you?\" protest is not a revolutionary one like that in the 1980s, the aim of which was to end the dictatorship. If today's student rebels have a cause, it is a highly diffuse one.\n\nFor Mr Ju the biggest problem is that Koreans do not ask themselves \"if they are OK\". And they put up with limitations on free expression. Police stood behind barricades in front of daejabo posted on the back gate of Seoul's government complex on December 19th, preventing people from reading them. The education ministry warned high schools that posters could have a \"negative effect on the learning environment\". Some schools have cut class discussion time; a school in Seoul's Gangnam district destroyed a daejabo by one of its pupils (he has taken the case to the human-rights court).\n\nMost participants have now taken down their own daejabo\u2014including Mr Ju himself, whose poster will be preserved in Korea University's museum as the \"document of a democratic movement\". For Mr Ju such posters are meant to be temporary. They are, he says, \"just the beginning\"."}

That person's voice rolled in the atmosphere, hurting their eardrums.\n\nLin Feng and the three others landed on the ground knowing that their pursuers had caught up with them. A cloud of dust arose around them as they landed. Lin Feng shouted, \"Tang You You, kill that cultivator of the seventh Xuan Qi layer first and then we will kill the others together!\"\n\n\"Alright!\" said Tang You You nodding. The four of them were ready.\n\nLin Feng took a gourd of Hot Unit and downed it to the last drop. His pure Qi seemed like it was boiling, it was flowing in his veins at full speed. While drinking and fighting, Lin Feng's pure Qi was gradually coming back to normal. The Hot Unit was progressively making the effects of the potions vanish.\n\n\"Die!\" shouted Tang You You when she saw someone riding a beast attack her by surprise. She transformed into an illusion and attacked that person with her fist. It seemed like a multitude of fists had appeared in the atmosphere.\n\nThat cultivator of the seventh Xuan Qi layer was astonished, his pure Qi started whistling in the air but would it suffice against Tang You You's fist? Of course not, his pure Qi was immediately destroyed and then vanished. Tang You You's fist crashed onto that person's chest, making him shake from head to foot. His blood vessels exploded, he groaned as he died with his eyes wide open.\n\nOne attack\u2026 The beautiful Tang You You only needed one punch to kill a man of the seventh Xuan Qi layer, even though she was several years younger than him. She was fast as lightning, her punches deadly. With her incredible abilities she only needed one punch\u2026\n\nLin Feng admired Tang You You and felt safe with her. He made another step and moved like the wind, he raised his fist around which appeared a terrifying fire. This time, he wasn't using his strength of the Herukas, he was using his scorching hot pure Qi sun fire.\n\n\"Die!\" shouted Lin Feng furiously. His pure Qi sun fire also contained some killer energy.\n\n\"Third Xuan Qi layer and you think you can fight against me with pure Qi\u2026\" said the opponent when he sensed Lin Feng's pure Qi sun fire. That person also raised his fist towards Lin Feng. Their fists were about to collide.\n\nVery subtly, Lin Feng's fist changed course from his fist towards the man's chest.\n\n\"Huh?\" that person was surprised. Lin Feng didn't mind receiving his punch just so he could punch him too?\n\nThe man with the sixth Xuan Qi layer was convinced that he wouldn't get hurt if Lin Feng punched him. He was willing to take Lin Feng's challenge. There was no suspense about to it.\n\n\"Boom!\"\n\n\"Boom boom!\" Two muffled sounds spreads in the air consecutively. The enemy's fist landed on Lin Feng's body, but Lin Feng hadn't died. He was, however, shaking violently. But immediately, a monstrous flame ignited on Lin Feng's body. It didn't seem like the opponent's fist was attacking Lin Feng, it seemed like his fist was drowning in fire.\n\n\"BOOM!\" A terrifying fire followed Lin Feng's arm and suddenly crashed onto that person's body, he sensed a monstrous pain spread all over. He lowered his head and saw a hole in his chest where a fire had just started. Very quickly, his entire body was covered with flames.\n\n\"Ahhhhh\u2026\u2026..\" A blood curdling shriek spread in the air and that person died.\n\nLin Feng was standing there surrounded by flames. He was becoming stronger and stronger. His entire body was diffusing some fire-red lights, he looked like a fire deity.\n\n\"His pure Qi is back to normal.\" thought Yun Fei Yang who was behind Lin Feng. A moment before, Lin Feng had gambled actually. He had bet that his pure Qi would get back the strength of the fourth Xuan Qi layer during the attack and it had worked. And yet, it seemed like it was still increasing\u2026.\n\nLin Feng moved and in a flash many bottles of Hot Unit appeared, they were those that Tang You You had just given to him.\n\n\"Kacha kacha!\" In a flash, all of them broke and a waterfall of Hot Unit liquor appeared in the air. Lin Feng opened his mouth and started inhaling with his mouth in an insane way. He was sucking in all the alcohol present in the air, he wasn't wasting a single drop of it. His mouth looked like an endless black hole.\n\n\"Boom boom boom!\" When the"}

It is tempting to imagine that this is simply a reflection of continuing power imbalances favoring men. Yet, there is a simpler explanation. Women care more about their appearance because looks are more consequential for them.\n\nIt is important to establish that feminine worries about physical attractiveness are not due to a general lack of that social psychologists see as emblematic of low social status in a society. As David Brooks (1) writes:\n\nFor decades, surveys indicated men had higher than women. But there is some evidence that the gap has narrowed or vanished. A 2011 study from the University of Basel based on surveys of 7,100 young adults found that young women had as much self-esteem as young men.\n\nDespite higher global self-esteem, women do not feel good about their appearance. This disconnect can be attributed, at least in part, to concerns about . According to Linda Jackson, \"Although females are more dissatisfied with almost all aspects of their bodies than are males, most of their dissatisfaction centers around weight issues, namely, around being too fat.\" (2, p.186)\n\nConcern about being overweight is unlikely to go away for two good reasons. The first is that overweight is becoming a bigger objective problem as time goes on. The second is that the slender standard gets more extreme as women make strides in careers and project an image of professional competence rather than stereotypical femininity(3)\n\nWhy women are more concerned about their appearance\n\nIn general, women are much more concerned about their appearance than men are. The key reason for this is that their appearance is central to how they are evaluated by others (2).\n\nThat phenomenon is often rejected as \"lookism\" but giving it an unpleasant name is not going to make it go away. We sometimes need to remind ourselves that we are an evolved species on this planet.\n\nThe evolutionary process of sexual selection changes us so as to attract mates. Men's facial hair makes them more sexually attractive to women, for instance. This is a sexual signal analogous to the brightly colored feathers of peacocks and other male birds. This phenomenon was revealed in experiments but most women seem unaware of it (3).\n\nHumans are rather unusual in the sense that sexual selection affected both sexes but apparently did more work on females than on males. This is consistent with a variety of evidence that women's physical appearance is more important for their success than is true of men (2).\n\nSexual selection altered female facial proportions making them more stereotypically youthful. For that reason, highly attractive women such as movie stars seem much younger than their actual age.\n\nThe cosmetics industry also labors to remove signs of age-related damage to the skin. The relevant is that with women are less likely to conceive and have less of their reproductive lives ahead of them. Men who selected youthful-looking women as spouses would thus have sired more children.\n\nThe other key sexually-selected of women is their hour-glass shape that inspired painters over the ages. This stereotypically feminine shape is also exaggerated in highly attractive women such as movie stars and pageant winners (3). It is crafted by so that women are most curvaceous during the most fertile years of their lives.\n\nThe operation of sexual selection on women has numerous practical consequences. Women are perceived as more attractive than men. They are also perceived as sexier which is why attractive women are more prominently featured in advertisements on the premise that sex sells.\n\nWomen also spend huge amounts of money on clothes, cosmetics, and other products and services that enhance their physical appearance. One might argue that this is further evidence of insecurity about their appearance produced by the burden of being evaluated by men based on their appearance (lookism).\n\nYet, men often evince a frustrating obliviousness to the beauty endeavors of their sweethearts. I never heard a man saying he wished that his girlfriend would spend more time and money on her appearance.\n\nThe truth is that women's insecurity about their appearance is driven by with other women. We see this quite clearly in connection with the slender standard of attractiveness where women wish to be more slender than men find attractive (3). The reason, of course, is that they want to beat their competitors \u2013 other women.\n\n1. Brooks, D. (2013, April 22). The confidence questions.

{"id": 259170, "ended": true, "length": 991, "text": "Digging around in online bibliographies and the references in the backs of yellowing texts on comparative religion, I came upon a 40-year-old treasure (to me, anyway): Judaism and the Gentile Faiths, by Joseph P. Schultz. This is the kind of book that helps me understand not just \"Comparative Religion\" but \"Religion\": the meaning of the search for meaning, and how cross-fertilized our traditions, our spirits, and our religious ideas may really be.\n\nThe author takes a look at Judaism with a comparative lens, and finds intriguing connections -- not only theological, but possibly historical -- between Judaism and Eastern traditions, most notably Hinduism, Buddhism and Confucianism.\n\nSome fun facts:\n\nThe flowering of classical traditions in Judaism and Confucianism happened contemporaneously -- in or around the 5th century BCE. Inscriptions on a synagogue built in Kaifeng in 1163 CE showed that Jews may have arrived there during the Han dynasty (as far back as 206 BCE).\n\nIn the first century CE, Rome ruled the entire Mediterranean basin. The ruling class developed a taste for the finer things, including silk, which helped develop the trade route between Europe and China. Jews may have migrated along this route, especially after the collapse of the Jewish State and the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE.\n\nArab geographers noted the presence of Jews in China during the Tang dynasty (618-907 CE). It was there, according to Schultz, not only with indigenous religions, but also \"along with Islam, Manichaeism, Zoroastrianism, and Nestorian Christianity.\"\n\nJudaism, and especially the Rabbinic tradition, includes some philosophical statements that are remarkably consistent with Eastern philosophy:\n\n\"Everything is in the hands of Heaven but the fear of Heaven\" (Berakhot 33b) is very consistent with Confucianism, both in thought and in terminology. The Confucian li (among other things, 'correct conduct') and Judaism's halakhah (law or way) have many striking similarities. Confucius: \"What you do not want done to yourself do not do to others.\" Hillel: \"What is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor.\"\n\nJewish contact with India may have cross-pollinated Vedanta with Kabbalah.\n\nThe articulation by Aaron of Starosselje (a disciple of R. Shneur Zalman of Liadi, founder of Chabad) of the diversity of the world from the human vantage point, and the unity of the world from the Divine, are very similar to the Vedanta philosophy of Maya (illusion), and especially the school of Ramanuja, who held, according to Schultz, that \"God can only be known through the medium of Scripture.\"\n\nJewish and Buddhist ideas of death and rebirth bear some similarities, too. This may go back beyond Vedanta, even to similarities in the biographies of Moses and the Buddha: born to or raised by royal families, they took radical steps to break free from their physical and theological confinements -- Moses by plunging into the world, the Buddha by retreating from it -- or the other way around, depending on how you look at it.\n\nOf course, there's this one gigantic difference: \"a central Buddhist thesis,\" says Schultz, is that \"what we have been in life will condition our life after death,\" whereas in rabbinic Judaism \"God's permanent and constant direction of human affairs is everywhere assumed.\" In other words, in Eastern traditions, reality as we know it does not presuppose our alienation from and attempts at reunion with an omniscient and personal Creator. But it does operate according to laws and dynamics that both Eastern and Western traditions recognize and adhere to.\n\nSo what, right?\n\nIn Judaism, history is part of the moment -- this moment, every moment. History is the unfolding of a redemption. Events are foretold in prophecy and in history, moving toward an ultimate in-gathering. In, say, Mahayana Buddhism, this moment is This Moment. Every moment simply is, and does not bear with it the lengthening, crushing train of historical precedent.\n\nSo . . . is morality grounded in history, and a reality established by God? Or is morality merely one strand of dharmakhaya -- the ultimate reality that underlies everything? Is history our struggle to return to proto-awareness, or to finally arrive at it? Did medieval Jewish philosophers, as Schultz says, \"purchase God's purity at the expense of His living reality\" . . . or did they preserve the essence of Judaism in a time of upheaval, assimilation and persecution?\n\nStay tuned.\n\n--T.A."}

HoloLens did much more than I expected\u2014but made me question whether real people will actually use it in all the ways Microsoft imagines.\n\nHoloLens felt far less isolating and restrictive than the DK2 Oculus Rift headset\u2014but I still felt trapped inside a piece of alien technology. And, yeah, strapped down tight, HoloLens wasn't comfortable to wear. The pressure on the bridge of my nose was intense. It left a funny taste in my mouth.\n\nI collected all these experiences during a brief press demo at Build 2015 on Thursday night. You can read all about how Microsoft uses advanced sensors to project holographic images onto the user's environment here. But if you just want to know what HoloLens is like to use, follow along and I'll regale you with a tale of high-tech trippiness that everyone should experience at least once.\n\nJon Phillips Journalists were allowed to photograph HoloLens behind a glass case. And then all recording equipment was confiscated before the actual demo.\n\nPreparing for reality phase-shifting\n\nAttending journalists are broken up into groups of eight. Why such small collections? Because we're being led into what can only be called custom-built holographic experience rooms in a nearby hotel. One room per person. As our procession of would-be holographic space travelers marches down the hotel hallway, we're cheered along by Microsoft employees. Their overall vibe is, \"You're embarking on a life-changing experience and we're very, very happy for you.\"\n\nI feel like Richard Dreyfuss at the end of Close Encounters when he's suited up and marching toward the alien mothership.\n\nThe physical Trimble maquette as it appears in the HoloLens demo video. This is basically what the model looked like during my real-time demo.\n\nMicrosoft also amps up the intrigue by requiring us to put all recording devices in lockers. Are they actually concerned about uncontrolled photography, or just looking to heighten intrigue further? If the latter, kudos. Because who remembers Apple Watch now.\n\nI enter the hotel room. I'll be experiencing the Trimble demo. It's a software package that helps architects envision how their designs will appear in the real world in a much more vivid, palpable, actionable way. Front and center in the hotel room is a small-scale physical model of a building. I love small models of buildings! And tonight I learn they're called maquettes.\n\nTwo Microsoft employees serve as my trip advisors. Their patter is cheery and scripted. They can't answer technical questions. I am not allowed to place HoloLens on my head myself. Instead, my peppy new buddy lowers it onto my head, and then I grab and push down on HoloLens' two arms to establish a snugger fit.\n\nThe maquette with a holographic overlay. Again, this shot is from the controlled video. What I saw during the demo was drastically less detailed.\n\nBut there's one last step. My pal tightens up HoloLens even more with a twist of an adjustment wheel at the rear of the headset. I feel like the apparatus is being screwed into my head. I might be experiencing what the Mayans felt during humankind's earliest brain surgery. I briefly consider the Mayans also did peyote. And now I'll be doing HoloLens. There's some parallelism here.\n\nThe headset is super-tight against the bridge of my nose. It provokes a funny taste in my mouth. But soon the trip begins, and I'm transported into augmented reality.\n\nLow-res but still breathtaking\n\nWith HoloLens active, the Trimble maquette comes alive with a holographic overlay. It's bright. Color is vivid. Resolution isn't bad for this particular task at hand\u2014I'm guessing 1024x768-ish, maybe 1280x1024-ish. It doesn't look as high-res as what appears in Microsoft's published HoloLensTrimble video, and the modeling throughout my demo isn't as detailed as what appears in that video's walkthrough. But the sum-total effect is still breathtaking.\n\nUsing the mouse of a nearby PC, I can cursor directly from the PC's real-world display to the hologram image on the table nearby. The cursor flow from flat display to the 3D hologram is seamless. I click on the top of the holographic building and drag my cursor\u2014I just added a few floors. All the building tops are active.\n\nAnother still from the controlled Trimble video. You can seamlessly flow from desktop PC to hologram.\n\nThe holographic maquette is an adjustable 3D model, and aside from the pressure on the bridge of my nose and the sheer first-time trippiness of using HoloLens, manipulating the experience feels relatively natural"}

The current leader of the NRA used to support these background checks.\"\n\n\u2014 President Obama, remarks on Senate vote on gun bill, April 17, 2013\n\nSome readers were curious to learn more about the National Rifle Association's purported support for background checks. As it happens, there is a bit of fact checker dispute about this history.\n\nPolitiFact in March rated as \"true\" this statement by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg: \"In fact, if you go back to 1999, [NRA chief executive] Wayne LaPierre testified on behalf of the NRA that background checks were appropriate and should be done.\"\n\nBut last week FactCheck.org dinged Vice President Biden for making a claim similar to the president. FactCheck.org, which issues no ratings, said Biden described the NRA's policies through \"rose-colored glasses,\" because the organization only supported language denounced as a sham by then-President Bill Clinton.\n\nWhen fact checkers disagree, it's often because the statements being vetted are slightly different. Bloomberg, for instance, carefully did not use the word \"support\" and he did not refer to the \"good old days\" of working with the NRA, as Biden did. (PolitiFact, however, on Thursday reiterated its \"true' ruling for Obama's statement above.)\n\nThe Fact Checker has learned from decades of covering politics and diplomacy that looking at the words sometimes is not enough; actions are also important. Is this a case where \"support\" for a particular action may have only been tactical, designed to block or kill proposals that pose a danger to an organization?\n\nAs former House speaker Newt Gingrich memorably explained during the GOP presidential debates in 2011, the individual mandate that formed the core of President Obama's health care law was originally designed to block health reform efforts by Hillary Clinton: \"In 1993, in fighting HillaryCare, virtually every conservative saw the mandate as a less-dangerous future than what Hillary was trying to do\u2026.It's now clear that the mandate, I think, is clearly unconstitutional. But, it started as a conservative effort to stop HillaryCare in the 1990s.\"\n\nIn other words, it was tactical maneuver \u2014 subject to change later.\n\nThe history of the NRA's \"support\" for expanded background checks is worth recounting, in part because it has striking resemblances to the current gun-control battle.\n\nThe Facts\n\nAs with this year, the gun-control battle of 1999 was sparked by a horrific school shooting: the April 20, 1999, Columbine High School massacre in which two students killed 12 students and a teacher before committing suicide. President Clinton, similar to President Obama, pushed for immediate action on gun-control legislation.\n\nIn the context of Columbine, LaPierre testified before a panel of the House Judiciary Committee, and trod a very careful line between \"what's reasonable and what's not.\" So, LaPierre said he was in favor of \"instant checks at gun shows just like at gun stores and pawn shops.\" But then he described as \"unreasonable\" nine aspects of the key legislation being pushed by Democrats at the time, led by Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.).\n\nEssentially, he opposed the entire Lautenberg bill as \"made-for-TV lawmaking\"\u2014and the NRA lobbied hard against it. But it also ran an ad campaign in newspapers titled \"Be Reasonable\" that reprinted LaPierre's testimony. If you read his testimony, you will see that the crux of it is that existing laws must be better enforced \u2014 exactly the same position the NRA takes today.\n\nAlso, note that LaPierre uses the modifier \"instant\" before the word \"checks.\" That subtle word choice became important later in the debate.\n\nIn the legislative process, Lautenberg's proposal to expand background checks was increasingly weakened (the Internet was excluded, for instance) but when it came for a vote, it passed by 51-50, with Vice President Al Gore casting the deciding vote. The victory actually came about because one senator, Democrat Max Cleland of Georgia, changed his vote at the last minute after another school shooting the day of the vote in his home state.\n\nThat legislation did not have to meet the 60-vote hurdle that this week's gun amendment needed to achieve, so in some ways it was a less impressive victory. Still, at the time, it was viewed as a seminal moment. \"This is a turning point for our country,\" Gore declared.\n\nBut the NRA was just biding its time. The 51-50 vote on May 20,1999, turned out to be a Pyrrhic victory for gun-control advocates, similar to the successful vote earlier this month to proceed to debate on the gun amendments.\n\nWhen the House of Representatives took up the issue the following month, the NRA worked with a longtime supporter, Rep."}

It's all part of the apple isle's new renewable energy strategy.\n\nTasmania's energy vision is vastly different to that of the rest of the Australia, which relies almost exclusively on coal and other fossil fuels to generate electricity, placing Tassie in a unique position.\n\nDubbed 'Tasmania's Energy Strategy, Restoring Tasmania's Energy Advantage', the recently released white paper proposes to turn the state into a leading renewable energy hub, and part of the island's transformation is expected to be a major shift in transportation infrastructure.\n\nAs well as seeding EVs in government fleets, the white paper suggests providing incentives for private buyers to adopt EVs \u2013 a move that has been resisted at state and federal levels across Australia.\n\nElectric vehicle take-up rates have been rapid in countries where governments provide tax breaks or other inducements, which is the case in many US states, European countries and China, and this has in turn stimulated the rollout of vehicle battery fast-charge stations.\n\nMeanwhile Australians have no incentive to adopt electric cars, and the sales results reflect that.\n\nThe Holden Volt electric car is no longer sold in Australia, partly due to a lack of demand, while vehicles such as the BMW i3 and Nissan LEAF continue to sell in dribs and drabs.\n\nHowever, as battery technology continues to improve \u2013 increasing in capacity and reducing in price \u2013 the white paper suggests many residents will even look at leaving the grid. In this respect EVs will become vital to energy independence.\n\n\"Rapidly falling battery storage costs may cause some customers to consider disconnection from the grid,\" reads the government study. \"To the extent that this occurs, it will leave fewer customers to pay for the maintenance of the grid, resulting in even higher prices and driving even more customers off the grid.\"\n\nCars will be a key factor in pushing this shift, with several brands \u2013 including Tesla and Mercedes-Benz \u2013 looking at affordable home batteries powerful enough to keep households running and off the grid.\n\nWhile Tasmania is banking on electricity and EVs for its future energy strategy, the federal government appears more interested in another zero emission energy source.\n\nFederal science and industry minister Ian Macfarlane recently declared hydrogen, not battery-electricity, to be Australia's automotive transport 'fuel of the future'. He attended the opening of Australia's first hydrogen refuelling station, an initiative funded by Hyundai.\n\nMeanwhile Tesla is also pushing ahead with its own infrastructure on the Australian mainland, with a Goulburn fast charge station installed and plans to have a supercharger network by the end of 2015, allowing Telsa owners to drive from Sydney to Melbourne under electric power.\n\nAnother factor that could play a significant role in the future of EVs in Australia is, naturally, the price of electricity. The Tasmanian white paper notes that \"Retail electricity prices have rapidly escalated, largely as a result of significantly increased investment in networks,\" and will continue to do so.\n\n\"Consumers have responded to higher prices in a range of ways, including by investing in solar PV [photo-voltaic] and energy efficiency measures.\"\n\nIn the long term these responses, in Tasmania at least, are expected to lead to lower levels of electricity consumption, which \"is leading to concerns of a network 'death spiral',\" according to the white paper.\n\n\"This is compounded by tariff settings that are largely consumption based but the costs of providing the network are largely fixed.\"\n\nRooftop solar panels in Tasmania are predicted to jump from 70 mega watts to 300 mega watts in the next 10 years, which won't be good for electricity providers, but it will be good for people who want to run their household and indeed their motor vehicle cheaply and with zero emissions.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Australia's energy future \u2013 should the mainland try and follow Tasmania and encourage the adoption of EVs or are the other options \u2013 hydrogen, LPG, diesel \u2013 more feasible?

He said he liked the idea and promised that we would talk after he finished lunch. I went back to my table with Mr. Ruddy and two other guests he had for lunch: Andrew J. Stein, a former Manhattan borough president, and Lee Lipton, a local restaurant owner.\n\nFive minutes later, I heard the president call my name.\n\n\"Michael, come on, Michael,\" he said as he stood up.\n\n\"Come on, sit over there,\" he said as he motioned to a large empty table.\n\nWe sat down next to each other, I asked whether he was O.K. with me recording, he agreed and we were off. Mr. Trump immediately told me that there was no collusion between his associates and Russia's effort to influence the election \u2014 something he would repeat 15 more times during the interview.\n\nIt is unusual to land an interview with the president, but even more rare for a reporter to get him one-on-one. I knew that what I was doing was not going to go over well with the White House press office, which hates being blindsided by the president making news. But for much of the next half-hour, Mr. Trump and I sat alone.\n\nDuring our conversation in July, I learned the challenges this president poses in interviews. He can jump from an issue like the Russia investigation to a policy matter before going off on a tangent about something like his golf game. If you try to interrupt him, he often continues talking. Given this, I employed a strategy in which I asked questions about the most pressing issues of his presidency and then allowed him to talk.\n\nSome readers criticized my approach, saying I should have asked more follow-up questions. I believed it was more important to continue to allow the president to speak and let people make their own judgments about his statements. It was the best way to learn as much as possible about the president's mind-set and his views on issues like North Korea.\n\nIn the interview, the president did make news. He contradicted members of his own party, saying he believes the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, will treat him fairly. He said for the first time explicitly that he had gone soft on trade with China in the hopes that Beijing would help put pressure on North Korea to stop its nuclear weapons program. And he said that he never thought Roy Moore would win the Senate race in Alabama and that he had endorsed Mr. Moore only out of obligation.\n\nAt the end of the interview, Mr. Trump, who had asked about my golf game, told me that I should go out and play his course that afternoon. I told him I would not do that and I needed to file a story off the interview on deadline. He asked me to treat him fairly, we shook hands and I headed for my rental car. As I drove away from the club, I called my editors to tell them I had just spent half an hour alone with the president."}

Simply toss, flush, and your garbage is marvelously whooshed away to some watery subterranean netherworld, never to be seen again.\n\nOr so we like to think. In fact, such practices clog toilets, damage water treatment facilities, necessitate expensive cleanups, increase water bills, create raw sewage overflows, harm marine animals and create toxic environmental issues.\n\nWith that in mind, here are the things that often end up in the sewer system \u2014 none of which have any business being there.\n\nBaby wipes: Although these may be used to wipe your baby's bottom, they are not toilet paper. Baby wipes are thicker, sturdier, and do not break down easily, resulting in clogged systems. The same goes for wipes marketed towards adults. Even ones labeled \"flushable\" are better off in the trash instead of down the toilet. Just because it's flushable doesn't mean you have to.\n\nBand-Aids: Made of non-biodegradable materials, they easily tangle up with hair and fat to create blockages.\n\nCat litter: Scoopable and flushable cat litter sounds sensible, but in reality, it causes problems. Flushing litter and feces down the hatch not only causes plumbing problems, but it's possible that a parasite found in cat feces is killing sea otters and seals \u2014 and it could be coming from flushed cat waste.\n\nChewing gum: Flushing what is basically an adhesive down the toilet is not a sound practice, for obvious reasons.\n\nCigarette butts: Although they seem flushable, cigarette filters don't easily biodegrade and they are filled with chemicals, which leach into the wastewater.\n\nCondoms: Easy to flush, but not so easy on the sewer system. Condoms can inflate like balloons and cause fairly destructive obstructions.\n\nContact lenses: While tiny in size, these lenses are made of plastics that aren't biodegradable. A study estimates that 50,000 pounds of lenses end up down the drain instead of being thrown away in the trash or recycled. Bausch & Lomb offers a recycling program where you can either drop off used lenses at one of the 2,000 participating doctor's offices across the nation or mail them to the company.\n\nCosmetics: Your old moisturizer and other beauty care products can be potentially toxic and disruptive to wastewater treatment plants and septic systems.\n\nCotton balls and swabs: Cotton doesn't break down easily, and although it may take a while for cotton products to accumulate into a clog, they are difficult to dislodge once they do.\n\nSure, dental floss is small and barely noticeable. But it can still wreak havoc on drains and make its way to the ocean. (Photo: Lucky Business/Shutterstock)\n\nDental floss: Seemingly innocent, dental floss is non-biodegradable and wraps around small clogs and tangles them into bigger masses.\n\nDisposable diapers: It's hard to believe that one could even get a diaper to flush down the toilet, yet that hasn't stopped sewage workers from finding systems clogged with disposable nappies.\n\nDryer sheets: It's bad enough to tumble synthetic chemicals with your clothes, but flushing a dryer sheet afterwards is even worse. They retain synthetic chemicals that can get into the water system, and they are made from non-biodegradable materials.\n\nFeminine supplies: The padding and absorbent nature of these products make them too thick for the plumbing.\n\nFood fat: Grease and fat congeal once they cool down, turning into solid masses that block pipes and cause serious sewage problems. Sewer workers call the giant grease lumps \"fatbergs.\"\n\nFood: Although food is biodegradable, it can still lump together and cause clogs.\n\nHair: After cleaning your hairbrush, deposit the clump in the garbage not the toilet. It tangles, catches things, and clogs like crazy.\n\nPaper towels and napkins: Too sturdy for the pipes.\n\nPets: Yes, pets. Goldfish are commonly flushed, but small rodents (hamsters and gerbils) are also found in sewer systems. They're sturdy and they create clogs; consider a proper burial.\n\nPrescription medicines: No, no, no. Marine life does not need to ingest your old drugs, not to mention that flushed meds can work their way back into our drinking water. See the Food and Drug Administration guidelines for disposing of unwanted medications.\n\nUnfortunately, many items marketed as flushable, aren't. Here's a handy tip from the city of Tacoma's environmental services page: Take two bowls of water and put toilet paper in one, and place the test item (Kleenex, wipes, etc.) in"}
{"id": 259179, "ended": true, "length": 597, "text": "B ahar Mustafa, the welfare and diversity officer at Goldsmiths Students' Union, recently caused a media storm after she banned white men from attending an event aimed at challenging the 'white-centric culture of occupations'. Students have since launched a petition to have Mustafa sacked, citing her fondness for hashtags like #KillAllWhiteMen as proof that she is guilty of 'reverse racism'. Responding to the controversy, she said that, as an ethnic-minority woman, she 'cannot be racist or sexist to white men, because racism and sexism describe structures of privilege based on race and gender'.\n\nDivisive and petty though Mustafa's 'liberation' politics is, her no-whites rally is really nothing to get worked up about. Private campaign groups and organisations should have the liberty to organise \u2013 and discriminate \u2013 as they please. And the attempt to present Mustafa's Twitter tirades as 'hate speech' will only further entrench the sort of illiberal campus politics she herself promotes.\n\nWhat is concerning here is her definition of racism, which is now commonly spouted on campuses by pseudo-radicals. According to this definition, racism is not merely about racial prejudice or discrimination; in order to qualify as racist, those doing the discriminating must also occupy a position of power, of privilege, in society. The oppressor, therefore, has to be of a higher privilege level \u2013 in a predetermined hierarchy \u2013 than those they are 'oppressing'. Ditto for every other '-ism' and '-phobia'.\n\nThis obsession with 'power' and the eternal battle between the 'oppressor' and the 'oppressed' offers campus radicals a shockingly simplistic moral lens through which they now analyse every expression, action and concept. From this perspective, unfettered freedom of speech on campus, for instance, is seen as a tool of oppression, used only to entrench the privileged in their positions of power.\n\nAt best, this logic projects a patronising view of ethnic minorities as in need of constant protection from the 'privileged' realm of public life. At worst, it is fetishising victimhood by associating powerlessness with virtue. I only wish this way of thinking was confined to campuses, but the wider pseudo-left also deploys this kind of patronising, power-relations politics. A common criticism of the slain Charlie Hebdo cartoonists, for instance, was that they were 'punching down' \u2013 that is, satirising Muslims from a position of relative privilege. Similarly, while nominal leftists will happily mock the backward ways of Christianity \u2013 as a wealthy and privileged religion, it is fair game \u2013 Islam is seen as being off limits. This racialised outlook not only promotes a feeble view of particular groups \u2014 it also robs them of their moral agency, too. So, many commentators continue to interpret acts of jihadist violence as a natural response to alleged Western oppression."}

All previous editions can be found here.\n\nThere were rightful concerns over Achraf's rushed development, and the overall urgency to get him into the first team this season. There was no real pressure to sell Danilo \u2014 an unfulfilled, yet decent rotational piece \u2014 and Achraf was on his path of natural progress at Castilla. It was time for him to graduate Solari's school of tactical chaos, but it seemed almost clear that he'd take a stepping stone elsewhere, the same way Marcos Llorente and Jesus Vallejo did before joining the A-squad. Instead, Man City cut Real Madrid a big cheque for Danilo, and Real Madrid said 'OK' \u2014 adding the funds to the rising pile of cash they had acquired for other role players \u2014 and took a leap of faith with Hakimi.\n\nWhen Alvaro Odriozola didn't arrive from Real Sociedad this summer, Achraf's spot in the team became more and more real, and when the season started, even the skeptics (*raises hand*) started to accept (forced or otherwise) trust in Zidane's squad-building decisions. Besides, the Frenchman has earned that right.\n\nWhat's surprised us the most about Achraf this season: how much better he's been defensively than he's been offensively. With Castilla, Achraf would blitz past defenders so fast he'd leave a trail of smoke and fire behind his road-runner legs. He'd regularly out-pace wingers and full-backs to get into space and put in a dangerous cross. We haven't seen that version of Achraf consistently yet. His confidence in beating his man with the ball at his feet is low, still, and his crosses have been off the mark. But, get this kid into open water, and few can thwart his incisive runs into space. We saw it against Sevilla when he scored, and throughout the game he made the day miserable for Franco Vazquez and Lionel Carole.\n\nThis sequence, from start to finish, all in the span of 45 seconds, is great:\n\nAchraf is barely on the screen yet at the top of this play, but by the time Modric receives the ball and looks up, the Moroccan has already blurred himself up the field beyond Carole's blindspot. Modric slings the ball up field, and Achraf's low-driven ball is blocked and cleared, at which point Achraf has already out-gunned Nolito from a handicapped position to ensure Real Madrid remains in possession. Fast forward till the end: It's Achraf again who hedges centrally to retain the ball again, assuring Sevilla don't breathe in their own third.\n\nHakimi has tools \u2014 highly encouraging ones. The fact that he's struggled in some areas offensively, but looked good without the ball overall is a good sign \u2014 it means he brings things to the table that are conducive to Real Madrid winning even in games where his offense labours. He knows where to be, and when he's caught out, his pace can get him back into the correct spots in record time.\n\nHow many times have we seen Achraf this season look like he's about to fall behind, only to laugh at all of us, rev the engine, and turn on cruise control until the deed is done?:\n\nPoor Muriel thinks he's shaken off Achraf three separate times, but he can't. Hakimi is like a mini-Dhalsim.\n\nPace is a good fall-back, but relying on it as your first play can be troublesome. Couple it with IQ, and you're cooking. Achraf has both. Against Tottenham, and generally in times where we've seen Achraf (and the team collectively), most vulnerable, the Moroccan still shows us good things on the defensive end. Against Sevilla, his defensive awareness was something that stood out. He cut off passing lanes, clamped down on man-to-man defending, and anticipated where the ball would go:\n\nThere is a lot that goes into defending the flanks: Understanding when to shift forward and when to pull into reverse, knowing when you have coverage and when you don't, knowing when to double-up on the ball-carrier and when not to, and understanding the delicate art of attacking crosses while monitoring the far-post. You have to be positionally woke while reading the field as oppose to gazing on the ball in a vacuum.\n\nHere you can see Achraf checking over his shoulder to calculate where Nolito is. As he runs to cover, he can track both the crossing lane as well as the man, and is in a great position to snuff out the attack:\n\nIndividually, certain players in Real"}

Kepler has found more than half of all known exoplanets to date. The telescope has also spotted 3,200 additional planet candidates, and about 90 percent of them should end up being confirmed.\n\nFurthermore, a number of these future finds are likely to be small, rocky worlds with temperate, relatively hospitable surface conditions \u2014 in other words, planets a lot like Earth. At least two of the newly confirmed planets appear to meet that description, Kepler team members say.\n\nThose two planets, known as Kepler-438b and Kepler-442b, join six others that were added to Kepler's list in Seattle during the annual winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society. Kepler-438b orbits a relatively cool star that's 475 light-years away and is 12 percent bigger than Earth. Kepler-442b is 33 percent bigger than Earth, and is 1,100 light-years from us. [Gallery: A World of Kepler Planets]\n\nEight of the newly identified candidate planets appear to be between one and two times the size of Earth, and orbit in their stars' habitable zone \u2014 the area where water could exist in liquid form. Six of those candidates have parent stars that are similar to our own sun in size and temperature. However, all of the candidates require follow-up observations and analysis to verify they are actual planets.\n\n\"Kepler was designed to find these Earth analogues, and we always knew that the most interesting results would come at the end,\" Kepler mission scientist Natalie Batalha of NASA's Ames Research Center told Space.com last month. \"So we're just kind of ramping up toward those most interesting results.\"\n\nThe latest findings have been submitted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal and The Astrophysical Journal Supplement."}

Mr. Romney spent little in Mississippi, while the super PAC supporting him spent almost $1 million.\n\nMr. Friess, who has been the principal donor to the Red White and Blue Fund, said on Tuesday that he had not ruled out giving more, but that he did not believe it would be necessary.\n\n\"My assessment is that the role I needed to play is maybe accomplished,\" Mr. Friess said. \"I put"}

These unsubstantiated assertions, dating back three decades, are categorically false.\"\n\nMurray was elected mayor in 2013 after a long career in the Legislature, where he led efforts to legalize gay marriage in the state. As mayor he pushed to increase the city's minimum wage to $15 an hour and address the homelessness crisis in Seattle.\n\nIn the lawsuit filed in King County Superior Court, a 46-year-old man, identified only by the initials, D.H., said Murray \"raped and molested him\" over several years, beginning in 1986 \u2014 when he was 15 and addicted to crack cocaine, and when Murray was in his early 30s.\n\nThe man said he met Murray on a city bus, and Murray invited him back to his apartment, propositioning him for sex and haggling over the price.\n\nMurray paid him $10 to $20 for each of at least 50 encounters over the next four to five years, the lawsuit said.\n\n\"I have been dealing with this for over 30 years,\" the man, now sober for a year, told the Times.\n\nHe said he was coming forward as part of a \"healing process\" after years of \"the shame, the embarrassment, the guilt, the humiliation that I put myself through and that he put me through.\"\n\nThe man also said his father's recent death freed him of a desire to keep the abuse secret.\n\nThe newspaper also reported that two other men said they knew Murray when they lived in a Portland, Oregon, center for troubled children. Jeff Simpson and Lloyd Anderson accused Murray of abusing them in the 1980s and paying them for sex and said they'd be willing to testify about it, the Times said.\n\nThe Times said one of them talked with a social worker and detective at the time. No charges were filed and an entry in an old Multnomah County district attorney's database indicates the office considered but rejected a felony third-degree sodomy case in May 1984. Any other police and child welfare records would have been destroyed by now, officials said.\n\nSimpson and Anderson raised the allegations a decade ago in calls to reporters and Washington state lawmakers, and they repeated them in recent interviews with the Times.\n\nReading's statement acknowledged those accusations.\n\n\"The two older accusations were promoted by extreme right-wing anti-gay activists in the midst of the marriage equality campaign, and were thoroughly investigated and dismissed by both law enforcement authorities and the media,\" the statement said.\n\nSimpson, 49, said Murray \u2014 whom he thought of as a father \u2014 raped him over several years, starting at age 13, and in later years, paid him.\n\n\"I would really like for him to admit it and to take responsibility,\" Simpson told two Times reporters who visited him unannounced in Portland. \"I don't necessarily think that he destroyed my life but I believe a lot of the problems I have stemmed from this.\"\n\nSimpson tried to bring a lawsuit against Murray in 2007, with Anderson's support, but his lawyer withdrew from the case. In 2008, Simpson started calling media organizations and lawmakers in Olympia, saying Murray, then a state senator, was a pedophile who had sexually abused him.\n\nBefore his political career, Murray \u2014 one of seven children in an Irish Catholic family \u2014 considered the priesthood. He spent a year at a seminary in 1976 before studying sociology at the University of Portland, a private Catholic institution, according to news profiles.\n\nHaving sex with a child under 16 \u2014 the age of legal consent in Washington in 1986 and today \u2014 constitutes rape of a child under state law. The statute of limitations on any crime would have expired long ago.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and says D.H. has not previously made any financial demands of Murray."}

The purchase has fueled debate over whether a patchwork of laws and court rulings give too much weight to growers of thirsty crops such as alfalfa. Some answers to common questions about the deal:\n\n___\n\nQ: Why is Saudi Arabia's largest dairy company buying U.S. land?\n\nA: To conserve water, the country has adopted bans on selected crops. Agriculture accounted for 90 percent of Saudi Arabia's water consumption, according to a 2013 study by the Oxford Business Group.\n\nSaudi Arabia identified the United States as one of 16 countries for agricultural investment in 2010, according to a memo from the U.S. embassy in Riyadh to the U.S. Agriculture Department that was obtained by WikiLeaks. The embassy said the investment could be \"a tangible demonstration of the value of outreach to the Muslim world and (could) offer an opportunity to broaden and deepen our relationship.\" The memo noted that while food security has not been a major problem in Saudi Arabia, \"food prices have become politically sensitive.\"\n\n___\n\nQ: What do the locals think?\n\nA: Some have raised concern about the amount of water needed but many welcome the economic boost that Almarai has given as worries about China have dimmed prospects for alfalfa exports. Jack Seiler, who farms about 3,800 acres in Palo Verde Valley, now sells about 30 percent of his harvest to Almarai, compared with nothing a few years ago.\n\n\"They're banging it out, I'm telling you,\" said Seiler. \"They kind of cleaned us out of summer hay \u2026 They want to farm.\"\n\nSeiler voices more concern about the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. Last year, the nation's largest distributor of drinking water became Palo Verde Valley's largest landowner, tapping a deep distrust between farm and city that pervades the West.\n\n___\n\nQ: What are the water rights in these areas?\n\nA: Palo Verde Valley enjoys California's first rights to water from the Colorado River, a lifeline to seven Western U.S. states and northern Mexico. A 1922 compact that parceled out allotments gave California more than 10 times what Nevada got.\n\nCalifornia long consumed more Colorado River water than it was entitled to, which was never a problem until Sunbelt cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas began to clamor for their full share. A 2003 truce among California's warring water agencies kept the Palo Verde Irrigation District at the front of the line and also left the agricultural Imperial Valley near the top of the pecking order. That honored a Gold Rush era-doctrine that the first settlers to stake claim hold the highest-priority rights.\n\nLa Paz County, Arizona, is free of well-pumping restrictions that hamstring many of the state's largest cities under a 1980 law to protect aquifers. The city of Phoenix bought about 13,000 acres there in 1986 and sold it in 2012 after giving up on building infrastructure to carry water about 100 miles to the nation's sixth-largest city. The city of Scottsdale has about 1,200 acres in the area on the premise that it will eventually have a system to move water from farm to city."}

By virtue of steamrolling local taxi operations in cities all over the world, combined with cultivating cheerleaders in the business press and among Silicon Valley libertarians, Uber has managed to create an image of inevitability and invincibility. How much is hype and how much is real?\n\nAs transportation industry expert Hubert Horan will demonstrate in his four-part series, Uber has greatly oversold its case. There are no grounds for believing that Uber will ever be profitable, let alone justify its lofty valuation, absent perhaps the widespread implementation of driverless cars. Lambert has started digging into that issue, and his posts on that topic have consistently found that the technology would be vastly more difficult to develop and implement that its boosters acknowledge, would require substantial upgrading in roads, may never be viable in adverse weather conditions (snow and rain) and is least likely to be implemented in cities, which present far more daunting design demands that long-distance transport on highways.\n\nTellingly, earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank turned down the \"opportunity\" to sell Uber shares to high-net-worth individuals. The reason? The taxi ride company provided 290 pages of verbiage, but would not provide its net income or even annual revenues.\n\nBy Hubert Horan, who has 40 years of experience in the management and regulation of transportation companies (primarily airlines). Horan has no financial links with any urban car service industry competitors, investors or regulators, or any firms that work on behalf of industry participants.\n\nUber is currently the most highly valued private company in the world. Its primarily Silicon Valley-based investors have a achieved a venture capital valuation of $69 billion based on direct investment of over $13 billion. Uber hopes to earn billions in returns for those investors out of an urban car service industry that historically had razor-thin margins producing a commodity product. Although the industry has been competitively fragmented and structurally stable for over a century, Uber has been aggressively pursuing global industry dominance, in the belief that the industry has been radically transformed into a \"winner-take-all\" market.\n\nThis is the first of a series of articles addressing the question of whether Uber's pursuit of global industry dominance would actually improve the efficiency of the urban car service industry and improve overall economic welfare.\n\nFor Uber (or any other radical industry restructuring) to be welfare enhancing, it would have to clearly demonstrate:\n\nThe ability to earn sustainable profits in competitive markets large enough to provide attractive returns on its invested capital The ability to provide service at significantly lower cost, or the ability to produce much higher quality service at similar costs That it has created new sources of sustainable competitive advantages through major product redesigns and technology/process innovations that incumbent producers could not readily match, and Evidence that the newly-dominant company will have strong incentive to pass on a significant share of those efficiency gains to consumers.\n\nUnlike most startups, Uber did not enter the industry in pursuit of a significant market share, but was explicitly working to drive incumbents out of business and achieve global industry dominance. Uber's huge valuation was always predicated on the dramatic growth towards global dominance. Thus if Uber's valuation and industry dominance were to be welfare enhancing, Uber's efficiency and competitive advantages would need to be overwhelming, and there would need to be clear evidence of Uber's ability to generate large profits and consumer welfare benefits out of these advantages.\n\nWhile most media coverage focused on isolated Uber product attributes, or its corporate style and image, this series will focus on the overall economics of Uber, using the approaches that outsiders examining industry competitive dynamics or investment opportunities typically would. This first article will present evidence on Uber's profitability, while subsequent pieces will present evidence about cost efficiency, competitive advantage and the other issues critical to the larger economic welfare question.\n\nUber Has Operating Losses of $2 Billion a Year, More Than Any Startup in History\n\nPublished financial data shows that Uber is losing more money than any startup in history and that its ability to capture customers and drivers from incumbent operators is entirely due to $2 billion in annual investor subsidies. The vast majority of media coverage presumes Uber is following the path of prominent digitally-based startups whose large initial losses transformed into strong profits within a few years.\n\nThis presumption is contradicted by Uber's actual financial results, which show no meaningful margin"}

International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Yukiya Amano said Iran's commitments under the agreement are being implemented.\n\nFederica Mogherini pictured at a EU3/E3+3 and Iran ministerial meeting on JCPOA in September (Image: EU/European External Action Service)\n\nThe JCPOA was signed in July 2015 by Iran and the EU3/EU+3 (China, France, Germany, Russia, the UK and the USA - also referred to as the P5+1 - plus the European Union) and implemented in January 2016. Under its terms, Iran agreed to limit its uranium enrichment activities, eliminate its stockpile of medium-enriched uranium and limit its stockpile of low enriched uranium over the next 15 years. The agreement cleared the way for the lifting of nuclear-related economic sanctions imposed against Iran.\n\nThe Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA), passed by the US Congress in 2015, requires the US president periodically to certify that, among other things, Iran is fully implementing the agreement and that suspension of US sanctions is \"appropriate and proportionate\" to the measures being taken by Iran. Trump issued such certifications in April and July. The deadline for the next certification was 15 October.\n\n\"It is clearly not in the hands of any president of any country in the world to terminate an agreement of this sort.\"\n\n\nFederica Mogherini,\n\nEU Vice-President\n\nTrump said the Iranian regime had committed \"multiple violations\" of the agreement, claiming it had exceeded limits on heavy water quantities, \"failed to meet our expectations\" in terms of uranium enrichment centrifuge operations, and \"intimidated international inspectors into not using the full inspection authorities that the agreement calls for\".\n\n\"Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification,\" Trump said. He said work was under way in the US House and Senate to draft legislation to \"strengthen\" the INARA. \"However, in the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated. It is under continuous review, and our participation can be cancelled by me, as President, at any time,\" he said.\n\nAny decision on whether to reimpose US sanctions against Iran now rests with Congress.\n\nIAEA confirms compliance\n\nThe IAEA is responsible for verifying and implementing Iran's implementation of its nuclear-related commitments under the JCPOA, at the request of the United Nations Security Council. Amano said on 13 September the agency had so far had access to all the locations it needed to visit, while Iran's ongoing provisional implementation of the Additional Protocol to its Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA had given the agency's inspectors broader access to information and locations in Iran.\n\n\"As I have reported to the Board of Governors, the nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran under the JCPOA are being implemented,\" Amano said. \"At present, Iran is subject to the world's most robust nuclear verification regime,\" he added.\n\nDomestic issue\n\nEU Vice-President Federica Mogherini also said on 13 October there had been no violations of any of the commitments included in the JCPOA. The plan of action is an annex to a United Nations Security Council Resolution, not a bilateral agreement, and cannot be terminated by a single country, she said. \"It is clearly not in the hands of any president of any country in the world to terminate an agreement of this sort,\" Mogherini said.\n\nThe EU said today it considered Trump's decision not to certify Iran's compliance with the JCPOA as being in the context of an internal US process. \"The EU encourages the US to maintain its commitment to the JCPOA and to consider the implications for the security of the US, its partners and the region before taking further steps,\" it said.\n\nIt reiterated the need to address \"concerns related to ballistic missiles and increasing tensions in the region\" in \"the relevant formats and fora\" outside the JCPOA. \"At a time of acute nuclear threat the EU is determined to preserve the JCPOA as a key pillar of the international non-proliferation architecture,\" it said.\n\nPresident Hassan Rouhani of Iran said in a live televised speech that the country would continue to cooperate with the IAEA and the JCPOA which he described as a multilateral and international treaty. \"[A]s long as our interests require and, as long as we enjoy its benefits, we will respect the JCP"}

What used to be good now lurks at the bottom of the totem pole and many threats that had previously been overlooked due to rogue dominance now get to show their true colors. At the forefront of all the action and the top of the ladder is the TL Hearthstone writing team. We've been documenting some of the subtle changes at the current highest echelon of Hearthstone and today we'd like to share them with you. This is monk bringing you the first article in what is sure to be a long line of Hearthstone updates.\n\nShifts in Class Usage\n\nMost Used Classes in TLOpen #1\n\nClass Usage # Usage % Druid 7 5.0% Hunter 16 11.4% Mage 27 19.3% Paladin 18 12.9% Priest 30 21.4% Rogue 5 3.6% Shaman 7 5.0% Warlock 9 6.4% Warrior 21 15.0% Total 140 100.0%\n\n\nDruids were more off the radar, but I would argue equally as strong, being omnipresent at the top of the ladder. Two common Druid archetypes included a more Gadgetzan Auctioneer\n\n\nOf course, both classes were nerfed quite heavily in the huge patch and the results showed in our first Teamliquid Open tournament that featured 140 players. Priests and Mages dominated the signups while Rogues and Druids were almost nowhere to be seen. Keep in mind, however, that this sample size consists of players from all different skill levels and lower level players may be swayed by hype coming from more professional players. So are Rogues and Druids are truly bad classes now or is it just people recoiling too much at the nerfs and too eager to try out their new Priest toys?\n\n\nLet's take a look from another perspective. Below is data on class distribution collected from the top of the NA ladder in the last week. As members of the TL Hearthstone coverage team laddered (while maintaining 90% win rates), we collected data about what classes we faced. The results are not too surprising:\n\n\nMost Used Classes at the Top of the Ladder\n\nClass Usage # Usage % Druid 12 9.1% Hunter 17 12.9% Mage 17 12.9% Paladin 14 10.6% Priest 24 18.2% Rogue 7 5.3% Shaman 10 7.6% Warlock 18 13.6% Warrior 13 9.9% Total 133 100.0%\n\nApparently, the best players on NA seem to agree with the sentiment that Priest is the best class. And I would certainly agree it's one of the most consistent classes to play with if you intended to go into the late game. Almost all Priest decks are control decks to some degree, though some choose to focus more on the early game, while others attempt to stabilize more in the midgame.\n\n\nWarlock might be a surprising pick on this list, but it's actually the most versatile class. It can play all sorts of aggro styles, including Murloc aggro. On the flip side, it can also play control with Twisting Nether Malygos Soulfire\n\n\nMage can run both aggro, which runs more Pyroblast Flamestrike Flamestrike Pyroblast Flamestrike Cone of Cold\n\n\nHunter decks are usually a mix of One-Turn-Kill Unleash the Hounds King Krush Unleash the Hounds\n\n\nPaladin are often played as aggro decks, using Divine Shield and Sword of Justice Tirion Ragnaros Ysera\n\n\nWarrior decks can mainly be broken into two types. There's the enrage combos that are the more standard versions and what you typically see from them(mostly because the cards used to build those decks are commons). Then you have decks based on variations of Shield Block Shield Slam Molten Giant Warsong Commander Youthful Brewmaster Bloodsail Raider\n\n\nDruids are still doing what they know best, mostly late-game control decks. Unfortunately, the number of win-conditions they have has greatly been decreased thanks to the patch. No longer can they sit on a mountain of cards only to directly go for the throat at their opponents' life in one swoop. Another factor is the popularity of Priests, a class which I consider to have a slight class advantage against Druids.\n\n\nShaman is in kind of an awkward position in the world. They're not really bad at all, but not really too great at anything. Decks that rely on Bloodlust\n\n\nAnd last and least is our poor Rogues. They're still running the same three types of decks that they used to: Spellpower, Weapon, Miracle Rogue. (And yes, people still attempt Miracle Rogue combos.) However, I'd say they're certainly less threatening than they use to be.\n\n\nMost Used Classes Pre-Patch\n\nClass Usage # Usage % Druid 8 12"}

They also transitioned to Open Source office solutions in 2003 with the idea of reduce licensing costs while stimulating local companies to develop products for the government.\n\nUnfortunately the lack of skilled professionals and scarcity of specialized providers meant the initiative lost momentum, and the government has now approved a massive procurement exercise of Microsoft products over the next few months to standardize the IT applications portfolio across departments and generate cost efficiencies.\n\nGovernment departments will now be able to buy Microsoft products as required at previously negotiated prices within a 12 month period without the need to launch new tendering processes, with products most likely to be purchased by departments including Windows 10, Windows Server and the Office suite.\n\nThe move is just another example of a case where ideology got ahead of the need to get serious work done, and where procurers finally discovered that it does not pay to cheapen out on the tools needed to get the job done."}

Things look promising. New documentary discussing childbirth as the most pressing global Human Rights issue premieres all over the world on Thursday September 20th.\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\n\nFreedom For Birth World Premiere\n\nPRLog (Press Release) \u2013 Sep 13, 2012 \u2013\n\nOttawa, Ontario \u2013 One needn't talk to many people to hear a childbirth horror story. The question Dr. Nancy Salgueiro asks is \"Women are submitting to or being forced into procedures they do not want or need when giving birth. Why are women laying down and accepting the abuses happening in childbirth?\"\n\nDr. Nancy Salgueiro, a leading expert in childbirth education and women's empowerment revealed, \"There are women and babies being victimized and traumatized by abusive treatment and unnecessary medical interventions in birth.\"\n\nDiscussions with women who have experienced childbirth uncover:\n\n\u2022 Women are given misleading information making them feel as if procedures are necessary when they are not.\n\n\u2022 Women are being told they are incapable of birthing their own baby and must trust in system that does not support normal birth.\n\n\u2022 Women are being forced to birth in institutions because of lack of access to birth attendants outside hospitals.\n\n\u2022 Women are abused and assaulted by procedures done to their bodies without consent and even after consent is withdrawn.\n\n\u2022 Women are being told they have no choices and must comply with medical orders or be threatened that their child may be taken from them.\n\nThe evidence is clear as to how to have a safe and gentle birth and yet the current birth climate is reflecting interventions not supported by research, record high rates of surgical births, and women experiencing post traumatic stress as a result of what has been termed \"birth rape\".\n\nHuman rights lawyers, film makers, and organizations like the Informed Choice Coalition are looking to change this.\n\nThursday, September 20, 2012 marks the world premier of the Freedom for Birth.\n\nFreedom for Birth is a 60 minute documentary featuring a Who's Who of leading birth experts and international Human Rights lawyers all calling for radical change to the world's maternity systems.\n\nHermine Hayes-Klein, US lawyer and organiser of the recent Human Rights in Childbirth Conference at the Hague, the Netherlands says, \"the way that childbirth is being managed in many countries around the world is deeply problematic. Millions of pregnant women are pushed into hospitals, pushed onto their back and cut open. They are subject to unnecessary pharmaceutical and surgical interventions that their care providers openly admit to imposing on them for reasons of finance and convenience. Women around the world are waking up to the fact that childbirth doesn't have to be like this and it shouldn't. Disrespect and abuse are not the necessary price of safety\".\n\nFreedom For Birth, made by British filmmakers Toni Harman and Alex Wakeford, tells the story of an Hungarian midwife Agnes Gereb. Ms Gereb has been jailed for supporting women who have chosen to give birth at home. Anna Ternovsky, a home birth mother supported by Ms Gereb decided to stand up for her right to choose the best birth for her baby.\n\nWhen pregnant with her second child, Ternovsky took her country of Hungary to the European Court of Human Rights. This landmark trial was a victory for women and has major implications for childbirth around the world.\n\nToni Harman, one of the filmmakers says, \"the Ternovsky vs Hungary ruling at the European Court of Human Rights in 2010 means that now in Europe, every birthing woman has the legal right to decide where and how she gives birth. And across the world, it means that if a woman feels like her Human Rights are being violated because her birth choices are not being fully supported, she could use the power of the law to protect those rights. With the release of \"Freedom For Birth\", we hope millions of women become aware of their legal rights and so our film has the potential to spark a revolution in maternity care across the world. In fact, we are calling this the Mothers' Revolution.\""}

The series has averaged one game a year across its decade-long lifespan, with the clumsily titled QForce marking the 11th outing for the quick-witted lombax and his mechanical pal.\n\nMost game series have run out of steam after reaching this milestone, with the sort of 3D platform romps that Ratchet and Clank inhabit proving especially susceptible to the rigours of age. Perhaps that's why Insomniac's most recent entries have felt a little... desperate. Between last year's limp and chaotic co-op scramble All 4 One and QForce's attempt to inject mob strategy into the series, it seems confidence in the characters' core appeal is at a low ebb. QForce is a platform game that's apparently terrified of being a platform game.\n\nInstead, it's a tower defence hybrid, and a sadly clumsy one at that. Each level is now a self-contained maze with a mass of generators at one end. If the enemy destroys all of these, it's game over. Access to this area is down two linear pathways, along which are scattered fixed points where you can place turrets, mines and barriers. Periodically, waves of enemies start marching towards your position and you must repel them by any means necessary.\n\nWeapons level up with use, with three tiers of increasing power to unlock.\n\nSo far, so predictable. However, you need to be a bit more proactive than simply fortifying your choke points and waiting. In between attacks, you need to venture out into the level to accomplish a variety of tasks. Your main goal is to activate the key nodes needed to reboot the planetary defence systems for each world. Doing this means running a gauntlet of various enemy types and destroying a series of shields.\n\nThe problem is that you start each level without any weapons other than your trusty wrench, and so must also scout around the level seeking out weapon pods to gain access to such tools and gadgets as the Warmonger, Thundersmack and other familiar arsenal items from previous games.\n\nYou're also on the lookout for crates that can be smashed in order to earn the nuts and bolts required to purchase the various defences for your base. These accumulate slowly - a good foraging expedition generally nets around 5000 - and since the most effective turrets and barriers cost at least several thousand each, it takes several rounds to set up even a basic defensive line.\n\nIt's not as if these expensive defences are particularly robust. Barriers crumble quickly and turrets seem to take more damage than they can dish out. The inevitable result of this is a constant back-and-forth as you abandon assaults on enemy positions or the hunt for a new weapon pod in order to dash back to base - through often confusing layouts - in order to do the job of fighting back yourself. Even then, you'll find yourself rushing from one side of the base area to the other, covering both entry points and bashing crates to restock on ammo and health, rather than relying on your feeble automated defences.\n\nYou can use rocket boots to get around faster, but at the cost of precision control.\n\nThe tower defence genre has always rested on a bedrock of frantic plate-spinning, but QForce takes it to a ludicrous extreme, spamming you with tough enemies, limiting your resources and generally making every inch of progress in the game's disappointingly thin story feel like more trouble than it's worth. This is a ferociously difficult game, but one that rarely feels like it's playing fair. Too often it seems to be punishing the player for stopping to think, exploring too far or simply trying something different.\n\nIf you're playing solo, that is. After the lukewarm reception that greeted All 4 One it's understandable that the co-op element has been downplayed for this entry, but that doesn't make it any less of a multiplayer game. With two players, either playing locally or online, things come into better focus. One can venture forth into the level while the other guards the base, or both can assault different enemy key nodes at the same time. More to the point, with two players in action accumulating currency, it's possible to stockpile bolts, establish a solid defensive line of turrets and engage with actual strategy rather than being constantly forced onto the back foot.\n\nThe game is more satisfying in co-op, but it still never really finds an enjoyable rhythm, the solo platforming and combat forever interrupted by the tower defence element rather than working in harmony. Third-person action and tower defence can work - see the superficially similar Orcs Must Die! - but QForce's clumsy genre patchwork feels more like an awkward attempt to latch onto a popular gameplay mechanic rather than an organic direction for the series to take.

The convening gathered together about 100 leaders from the public community and food and media companies to initiate an ongoing discussion about how to address the harmful effects of unhealthy food marketing on children. According to Mrs. Obama, \"The goal here is to empower parents instead of undermining them as they try to make healthier choices for their families.\"\n\nIn her appeal to industry leaders to market responsibly to children, the First Lady praised their and resources, \"And fortunately you have everything it takes to get this done because through the magic of marketing and , all of you, more than anyone else, have the power to shape our kids' tastes and desires.\"\n\nBut industry leaders do not want to take credit publicly for shaping kids' tastes and desires. We consistently hear the same message in our discussions with food industry executives, \"We only respond to consumer demand. If parents didn't want their children to eat these products, they should learn how to say 'no'.\"\n\nBut it makes no business sense for food and beverage companies to spend $1.8 billion every year in marketing specifically targeted to children and adolescents if they honestly believe that parents make all the food choices for their children. And it's hypocritical to blame parents for making poor choices when they harness their enormous marketing resources directed at children specifically to get around \"gatekeeper Mom\" (in the words of the marketers). Tactics like adding vitamin C to Popsicles or claims that Fruit Roll-ups are made with \"real fruit\"\u2014without mentioning the corn syrup, dried corn syrup and sugar also in the product\u2014are designed to make Moms feel ok about buying these products when their children ask for them.\n\nWe often hear another common argument for why food and media companies do not need to take responsibility for their child-targeted marketing practices: \"If parents don't want their children to see food advertising, they shouldn't let them sit in front of the TV or computer for hours. Send them outside to play instead! \"\n\nCompanies can get away with these arguments because parents are an easy target. Most Americans\u2014including most parents\u2014believe that parents are responsible for protecting their children from harmful influences in the media.\n\nTo illustrate just how difficult it would be for parents to stop their kids from seeing marketing messages for fast food and wanting the unhealthy products they push, the Rudd Center communications created a clever video.\n\nWe have received a lot of positive feedback on the video, but I was intrigued by one viewer's response: \"Just show kids why advertising is bad, and anyone trying to get profit has a motive to lie to you and exploit you. Then you can safely let them see any advertisement as much as you want (emphasis added).\"\n\nThis viewpoint exemplifies early theories of consumer development\u2014first proposed by Ward, Wackman and Wartella in the 1970's\u2014when companies first started to target advertising to children. These theories posit that once children understand the persuasive intent of advertising they possess a \" filter\" to protect them from unwanted influence.\n\nThis belief that children can be \"inoculated\" against the effects of advertising is the basis for teaching media literacy in schools. No one would argue that teaching children that advertising sometimes tries to exploit and even lie to consumers would be a bad thing. Except for one thing\u2014there is no evidence that the motives behind food advertising actually reduces its effects on children's food preferences.\n\nMany researchers have tried to show that media literacy training can teach children to resist advertising for unhealthy foods. These studies do show that media literacy can increase children's skepticism about food advertising. However, recent research also shows that greater skepticism does not reduce the effectiveness of food advertising.\n\nResearchers at the Rudd Center \u2013 and other colleagues who study food marketing\u2014can attest to just how difficult it is to resist these messages. We probably know more about food companies' marketing tactics and motives than almost anyone. I have an MBA in marketing from the Wharton School and worked as a marketing executive for 18 years\u2014and my colleagues and I have been studying food marketing to children for ten years. But at the end of a day spent watching fast food advertisements for our research, most of us still have to fight cravings for a Dairy Queen Blizzard or McDonald's french fries.\n\nFast food restaurants and other food and beverage companies know much more about how to make their products impossible to resist than psychologists or children's health advocates know about how to effectively counteract their appeals.\n\nIn the short term, it is good business for advertisers who target children to deflect criticism by saying they have no role in shaping kids' tastes and desires\u2014and blaming parents for poor . It is also in their best interests to support initiatives\u2014such as media literacy and promoting physical activity\u2014that place the onus on the individual to resist unwanted influence. But they cannot also claim that their actions support the First Lady's efforts to empower parents and help them raise healthy children."}

{"id": 259214, "ended": true, "length": 967, "text": "Colorado has 58 mountain peaks exceeding 14,000 feet (known as \"fourteeners\" or \"14ers\" locally) \u2014 the most of any state. Outdoor enthusiasts of all skill levels will find peaks ranging from easy to very difficult, with hiking trails for exploring the state's scenery, wildlife and rugged beauty.\n\nHiking a Colorado 14er\n\nSome of the Colorado's best-known fourteeners include the tallest, Mount Elbert; Pikes Peak, which inspired the poem \"America the Beautiful\"; and Longs Peak, which resides inside Rocky Mountain National Park. See a full list of 14ers and their elevations and an awesome infographic that describes what makes them so special to Coloradans. The reward for reaching the summit of one of these 14ers? Some of the most breathtaking views you'll find anywhere on the planet, as well as stargazing opportunities. But it's important to know a few things before you head out to these massive Colorado fourteeners. There is a debate about exactly how many 14ers there are in Colorado. The Colorado Geological Survey says there are 58 peaks that exceed 14,000 feet in elevation. Others use this logic: To qualify, a peak must rise at least 300 feet above the saddle that connects it to the nearest 14er peak (if another exists nearby). You can make up your own mind!\n\nIf you're looking for a bit more solitude, we recommend detouring from the very popular 14ers to a few of 580-plus 13ers in Colorado, which pack just as much adventure punch in slightly less elevation. (Read about a couple who has climbed all Colorado 13ers on the Colorado Outdoor Adventure Blog.)\n\nBe Aware of the Effects of Altitude\n\nWhile climbing up a fourteener can lead you to breathtaking views, the thinner air can lead to altitude sickness. Altitude sickness is brought on by a lack of oxygen to your body and a failure to acclimate to air that has less oxygen. It can be caused by going too high, too fast.\n\nThe problem is, everyone's body has a different rate of acclimating, so it's important to be aware of any changes you feel. The most widely felt symptom is a headache, but other symptoms include shortness of breath, tightness in the chest, marked fatigue and weakness. If you experience any of these, just follow the simple guidelines below and let others know you're not feeling 100 percent. Symptoms often improve once your body adapts to the higher elevation, but you need to be patient \u2014 and most importantly, keep hydrated and take it easy.\n\n\u2022 Drink plenty of water; replenishing fluids helps to stabilize your body.\n\n\u2022 Take it easy; don't over-exert yourself.\n\n\u2022 Experts recommend eating a high carbohydrate diet while at altitude.\n\n\u2022 Keep alcohol intake and smoking to a minimum.\n\n\u2022 Remember that altitude sickness can affect anybody, even top-flight athletes.\n\n\u2022 Most importantly: if you're not feeling well, let someone know.\n\nLeave No Trace\n\nColorado has the great fortune of having these 58 majestic fourteeners right in our backyard. But every year, an increasing number of hikers and climbers attempt to ascend one of these peaks, impacting the alpine environment. It is up to those who love these mountains to minimize damage to their fragile ecosystems. The Leave No Trace (LNT) program is dedicated to building awareness, appreciation, and most of all, respect for our public recreation places. It is not based on rules and regulations as much as attitude and awareness.\n\nPlease be sure to follow the Leave No Trace principles so that future generations can continue to enjoy Colorado's breathtaking mountains:\n\n\u2022 Rest on rocks, not on vegetation.\n\n\u2022 Leave what you find, including flowers and berries.\n\n\u2022 Pack out all food; don't throw it on the ground.\n\n\u2022 Conduct bathroom stops at least 200 feet from bodies of water.\n\n\u2022 Pack out toilet paper in plastic bags.\n\n\u2022 Stay on designated trails and don't cut across switchbacks.\n\n\u2022 Walk through puddles on the trail, not around them, to avoid creating wider or multiple trails.\n\n\u2022 Spread out when walking in areas where there is no trail.\n\n\u2022 Avoid loose rock debris covering a slope; use the most stable route.\n\nWant More?\n\nFor more information on the fourteeners in Colorado, including a complete list, trip reports and more, visit 14ers.com and the Colorado Fourteeners Initiative.

Well, that has now changed with the beta release of shopping in High Fidelity.\n\nThere has been a lot of media attention to this development, as High Fidelity has decided to implement a form of blockchain to prove valid ownership and combat content theft.\n\nCommerce in High Fidelity is currently limited to avatar accessories (not stand-alone objects) and it is currently restricted to just one domain, Avatar Island, where there are four separate stores for you to go shopping.\n\nOne thing I noticed immediately is that HiFi has put a lot of care and work into the design of Avatar Island. It looks really good and visually appealing, with helpful signs and maps to help the new user get oriented. Here's a picture I took in-world of a Japanese-themed store called Usagi:\n\nAnother nice thing is that there are actual mirrors in the stores so you can get a good look at yourself! We need mirrors in Sansar. (Actually, I first encountered working mirrors several years ago in a little-known virtual world called Twinity.)\n\nHere's a snapshot of my HiFi avatar (a standard-issue photo-realistic model from the \"free\" store), wearing a wizard hat and looking at himself in the mirror. I must admit that the ability to adjust what you are wearing just by tugging on it is a very nice feature to have. (I still can't figure out how to resize avatar attachments if they're too big, though.)\n\nYou can walk out of the store wearing something you haven't paid for yet, but if you teleport away from Avatar Island, the unpaid-for item automatically detaches itself from your avatar.\n\nHiFi's currency is called High Fidelity Coin (HFC for short), and anyone can request a free grant of 10,000 HFC as part of the beta test, simply by emailing info@highfidelity.com and giving HiFi your username and associated email address. I understand this takes about three days to process, so I am still impatiently waiting for some currency so I can finally buy things! (You cannot yet buy HFC using your credit card, as you can with Sansar dollars.)\n\nAnother interesting thing about this new endeavour is that it is an in-world shopping model, unlike Sansar's Web-based Sansar Store. There are even little green \"recycle\" bins in the stores, where you can deposit items you decided you don't want to buy after all. The High Fidelity shopping experience goes so far as to include check-out stands in each store, where you \"scan\" items that you wish to purchase, just like you can do at the self-check-out kiosks at many real-world stores and supermarkets!\n\nI did notice that you have to type in your passphrase on the user tablet which pops up when you use the check-out stands, which is still a real pain in the ass when you are in a VR headset. I'm still not sure how I feel about the whole tablet metaphor in High Fidelity. Sometimes I find it useful, other times I just find it irritating. At least you can reposition it so it doesn't block your view.\n\nHere's a YouTube promotional video of the whole in-world shopping experience:\n\nFrankly, I wish we had the option to do in-world shopping in Sansar much as we do in Second Life, but I certainly understand why Linden Lab started off with web-based shopping only (it's easier to implement). Having well-stocked in-world stores where the creator can arrange the wares to his or her taste has a certain charm and convenience, and I think it adds a lot to the overall shopping experience. In fact, there are already a few Sansar experiences which are essentially in-world showcases for a particular creator's products, like Alfy's oYo Showroom. We can expect to see more of these types of experiences as Sansar grows.\n\nShopping is a popular pastime in most virtual worlds, and people often put a lot of time and care into how their avatars look, and how they decorate their personal spaces. It will be interesting to watch how the retail landscape evolves in both Sansar and High Fidelity.\n\nAdvertisements"}

For example, the term \"boll weevils\" was frequently applied to conservative Democrats in the 1980s who consistently voted in favor of then Present Ronald Reagan 's increase of military spending, tax cuts and deregulation of the financial system.\n\nIn the United States, a member of the Democratic Party who holds personal political views that are conservative in comparison to those of the majority of his or her political party is known as a conservative democrat . Although views considered typical for a conservative democrat change over time, many support gun rights, a strong military, education, free market capitalism, smaller government, and fiscally conservative policies and may be anti-abortion with a demonstrably stronger religious orientation than moderate and liberal Democrats. Like liberal Republicans, conservative Democrats are a minority wing in the party but may provide deciding votes on divisive political issues.\n\nBefore 1964, both major parties were broken down into liberal, moderate and conservative factions. As the conservative wing of the Republican Party slowly rose to prominence and eventual dominance with the 1980 election of Reagan, Democrats underwent realignment. Rather than grow its conservative wing, the Democrats became markedly more moderate and most members joined the conservative and moderate Democratic Leadership Council.\n\nAs a partial result of the Democratic Party realignment, a conservative Democrat may sometimes find him or herself at odds with the party and more in agreement with Republicans. One of the main points of distinction between conservative Democrats and Republicans is the former's adherence to economic views that are liberal in comparison to those of the latter. In addition, a conservative Democrat may support increasing spending on education and other social programs that a moderate or conservative Republican would not.\n\nBeginning in 1994, conservative Democrats in the House of Representatives and the Senate began organizing themselves in coalitions and caucuses. One of the most well known of these groups in the House is the Blue Dog Democrats whose members profess to support national and financial security as well as bipartisanship. There are other conservative Democrat single-issue caucuses in the House that were formed by pro-life members or those that support gun rights. In the Senate, members of the Democratic Leadership Council generally adopt centrist positions on most issues and promote neo-liberal fiscal policy."}

{"id": 259224, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Quadratic Arithmetic Programs: from Zero to Hero\n\nThere has been a lot of interest lately in the technology behind zk-SNARKs, and people are increasingly trying to demystify something that many have come to call \"moon math\" due to its perceived sheer indecipherable complexity. zk-SNARKs are indeed quite challenging to grasp, especially due to the sheer number of moving parts that need to come together for the whole thing to work, but if we break the technology down piece by piece then comprehending it becomes simpler.\n\nThe purpose of this post is not to serve as a full introduction to zk-SNARKs; it assumes as background knowledge that (i) you know what zk-SNARKs are and what they do, and (ii) know enough math to be able to reason about things like polynomials (if the statement P(x) + Q(x) = (P + Q)(x) , where P and Q are polynomials, seems natural and obvious to you, then you're at the right level). Rather, the post digs deeper into the machinery behind the technology, and tries to explain as well as possible the first half of the pipeline, as drawn by zk-SNARK researcher Eran Tromer here:\n\nThe steps here can be broken up into two halves. First, zk-SNARKs cannot be applied to any computational problem directly; rather, you have to convert the problem into the right \"form\" for the problem to operate on. The form is called a \"quadratic arithmetic program\" (QAP), and transforming the code of a function into one of these is itself highly nontrivial. Along with the process for converting the code of a function into a QAP is another process that can be run alongside so that if you have an input to the code you can create a corresponding solution (sometimes called \"witness\" to the QAP). After this, there is another fairly intricate process for creating the actual \"zero knowledge proof\" for this witness, and a separate process for verifying a proof that someone else passes along to you, but these are details that are out of scope for this post.\n\nThe example that we will choose is a simple one: proving that you know the solution to a cubic equation: x**3 + x + 5 == 35 (hint: the answer is 3). This problem is simple enough that the resulting QAP will not be so large as to be intimidating, but nontrivial enough that you can see all of the machinery come into play.\n\nLet us write out our function as follows:\n\ndef qeval(x):\n\ny = x**3\n\nreturn x + y + 5\n\nThe simple special-purpose programming language that we are using here supports basic arithmetic (+, -, *, /), constant-power exponentiation (x**7 but not x**y) and variable assignment, which is powerful enough that you can theoretically do any computation inside of it (as long as the number of computational steps is bounded; no loops allowed). Note that modulo (%) and comparison operators (<, >, \u2264, \u2265) are NOT supported, as there is no efficient way to do modulo or comparison directly in finite cyclic group arithmetic (be thankful for this; if there was a way to do either one, then elliptic curve cryptography would be broken faster than you can say \"binary search\" and \"Chinese remainder theorem\").\n\nYou can extend the language to modulo and comparisons by providing bit decompositions (eg. 13 = 2**3 + 2**2 + 1) as auxiliary inputs, proving correctness of those decompositions and doing the math in binary circuits; in finite field arithmetic, doing equality (==) checks is also doable and in fact a bit easier, but these are both details we won't get into right now. We can extend the language to support conditionals (eg. if x < 5: y = 7; else: y = 9 ) by converting them to an arithmetic form: y = 7 * (x < 5) + 9 * (x >= 5) ; though note that both \"paths\" of the conditional would need to be executed, and if you have many nested conditionals then this can lead to a large amount of overhead.\n\nLet us now go through this process step by step. If you want to do this yourself for any piece of code, I implemented a compiler here (for educational purposes only; not ready for making QAPs for real-world zk-SNARKs quite yet!).\n\nFlattening\n\nThe first step is a \"flattening\" procedure, where we convert the original code, which may contain arbitrarily complex statements and expressions, into a sequence of statements that are of two forms: x = y (where y can be a variable or a number)and x = y (op) z"}

A 25-year-old woman was found alive Sunday evening in the ruins of the Roa-Roa Hotel, according to the National Search and Rescue Agency, which released photos of the her lying on a stretcher covered in a blanket.\n\nAt least 832 people were confirmed dead as of Sunday evening, Indonesia's disaster agency said, with nearly all of those from Palu. The regencies of Donggala, Sigi and Parigi Moutong \u2014 with a combined population of 1.2 million \u2014 had yet to be fully assessed.\n\n\"The death toll is believed to be still increasing, since many bodies were still under the wreckage, while many have not been reached,\" said disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.\n\nThe cries from beneath the Roa-Roa Hotel, which appeared to have toppled over with its walls splintered like pickup sticks, went silent by Sunday afternoon. Officials had estimated about 50 people could be inside.\n\n\"We are trying our best. Time is so important here to save people,\" said Muhammad Syaugi, head of the national search and rescue team. \"Heavy equipment is on the way.\"\n\nMetro TV showed about a dozen rescuers in orange jumpsuits climbing over debris with a stretcher carrying the body of a victim from the modest business hotel.\n\nOther rescuers worked to free a 15-year-old girl trapped under concrete in her house in Palu after it collapsed on her family during the earthquake. Unable to move her legs under the rubble, Nurul Istikharah was trapped beside her dead mother and niece. Rescuers also tried to control water from a leaking pipe, fearing she would drown.\n\nIstikharah was unconscious during part of the effort to free her, but rescuers kept talking to her to try to keep her awake. Others offered her food and water.\n\nIndonesian President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo toured Palu on Sunday and said rescuers were having difficulty reaching victims because of a shortage of heavy equipment.\n\n\"There are many challenges,\" Jokowi said. \"We have to do many things soon, but conditions do not allow us to do so.\"\n\nHe said authorities were deploying more heavy machinery so emergency workers can help recover more victims Monday.\n\nThe stricken areas also needed medical supplies, fuel, fresh water and experts.\n\nIt was the latest natural disaster to hit Indonesia, which is frequently struck by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis because of its location on the \"Ring of Fire,\" an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin. In December 2004, a massive magnitude 9.1 earthquake off Sumatra island in western Indonesia triggered a tsunami that killed 230,000 people in a dozen countries. More recently, a powerful quake on the island of Lombok killed 505 people in August.\n\nIn Donggala, the site closest to the earthquake's epicenter, aerial footage on Metro TV showed the sugary blond sands of beaches swept out to sea, along with some buildings. Some buildings in the town were severely damaged, with plywood walls shredded and chunks of concrete scattered on the pavement. Much of the damage, however, appeared limited to the waterfront.\n\nPalu, which has more than 380,000 people, was strewn with debris from the earthquake and tsunami. A heavily damaged mosque was half submerged and a shopping mall was reduced to a crumpled hulk. A large bridge with yellow arches had collapsed.\n\nThe city is built around a narrow bay that apparently magnified the force of the tsunami as the waves raced"}

Yuri \"Keith\" Jew ascended as high as the sixth spot in the solo queue ladder, and made friends (and probably some enemies) along the way by playfully spamming his famous team owner's name in every game he loaded into. By the time Echo Fox had departed to return for the summer split of the NA League Championship Series, the expectations for Keith's sophomore season on EF had risen like his rank in South Korea.\n\n\"It was all good. I loved playing in Korea,\" told Keith ESPN after sweeping Phoenix1 2-0. \"It's so competitive in solo queue, and I pretty much got along with everyone. Maybe it's because they thought I was funny by spamming \"Rick Fox\". I just started adding pros by looking them up on OP.GG, and if they were a pro I know, I'd pretty much say hi.

A talented player online, he was in the Team Liquid system as a substitute and minor league player before getting called up to sub in for a struggling Chae \"Piglet\" Gwang-jin. Keith replaced the former world champion, who was having issues assimilating into his newfound career in the United States, and played brilliantly in the time allotted to him. His cleanup AD carry play style brought success to the once dysfunctional Liquid starting roster. Alas, the impressive stint wasn't enough to win the starting job, and Keith was sent back to the world of semi-pros and journeymen.\n\n\"I mostly soloed,\" he said about his climb up the Korean online hierarchy over the duration of Echo Fox's boot camp. \"Maybe 10% were dynamic queue. I don't want [people] to be like: 'This guy abused dynamic queue. What a boosted player,' and yeah, it was mostly solo. Sometimes I'll duo with Gorilla [ROX Tigers' support], and I'd say I'm pretty close friends with him now. Actually, I had this long streak of unlucky games where I never got my role. I just played support four games, and then jungle like two games, and top. That's where I started losing, so I couldn't get rank one, unfortunately.\"\n\nAt an individual level, at least online, Keith doesn't see a barrier between himself and the superstars of Korea's Champions competition. For the first few seasons of his career, that talent gleamed through, but was quickly forgotten due to him being relegated to sub status. Regardless of how well he played around the team in front of him or what his solo queue standing showed, the young AD carry was never the first option -- always the bridesmaid, never the bride.\n\n\"Gorilla is my favorite [Korean pro I played with during the bootcamp] because he's so nice to me. We won like every game if we got our [respective] roles.,\" he admitted. \"They're all friendly, and I'd say I like all of them. But if you asked me who was the best player I played against, I'd say [ESC] Ever's Loken. I think that guy is so good.\"\n\nEcho Fox is Keith's first real chance at being able to show the skill he's showcased countless times in online form. His days on Team Liquid were overshadowed by Piglet's growing pains, and the same storyline occurred when he subbed in to light a fire under Team SoloMid's then starting AD carry Jason \"WildTurtle\" Tran a split later. Last season on FOX was supposed to be his coming out party, but even that was disrupted with a myriad of visa issues and constant roster switches.\n\nThis split, however, there are no excuses.

There are no AD carries looking to put Keith back on the bench, and the visa issues that plagued the team last split have been rectified. If there was ever a moment for"}

Same for the sold items, which can be bought back for the price they were sold for. After the trading screen is closed, the items sold to the trader will be priced at the usual full price + markup, and the items bought from him will only yield the usual selling price.\n\nTips Edit\n\nLoot sold at either the Party Camp or Warden's Keep will remain in these merchants' respective inventories.

This means that the PC can still buy items back, albeit at a higher price, as long as the merchant remains available. The party camp merchant will reset his inventory twice based on certain plot events. Consider using these merchants for items to recover some day, and avoid selling them extraneous junk, as this will make it more difficult to find useful items sold to them.\n\nThe party camp merchant also has the highest prices in the early game (50% markup), so avoid buying from him what you could find elsewhere.\n\nDragon Age: Origins Edit\n\nDragon Age: Origins - Awakening Edit\n\nLeliana's Song Edit\n\nMerchant City / Landmark Buy price Sell price Notable items Notes Bonny Lem Denerim Market District, Hideout, Chantry 105% 25% Accessories, Tomes, Armor, Potions\n\nWitch Hunt Edit\n\nMerchant City / Landmark Buy price Sell price Notable items Notes Sandal Circle Tower, Apprentice Quarters 115% 25% Accessories, Rune-crafting materials, Tomes Also provides enchanting services\n\nSee also Edit"}

We have concluded that it is not in our commercial interest to continue providing Fox News in the UK.\"\n\n\nFox News has become increasingly troublesome for the Murdochs as they attempt to buy Sky.\n\nThe channel is embroiled in a sexual harassment scandal that led to a string of high-profile figures leaving, including the chairman Roger Ailes, who has since died, and leading presenter Bill O'Reilly.\n\nIt has also been accused of colluding with Donald Trump's White House on a discredited story about a murdered Democrat activist, which critics of the Murdochs have compared to the News of the World hacking the phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler.\n\nOfcom, the UK media regulator, has also made a number of rulings against Fox News broadcasts in the last year, adding to the total of 22 breaches by Fox of its licence and Ofcom's codes and rules in the last decade. Of those, Fox News was responsible for seven, including four last year, one of them being a programme which featured a guest who said Birmingham was a city \"where non-Muslims just simply don't go\".\n\nTom Watson, the deputy Labour leader and shadow culture secretary, said the disappearance of Fox News from British screens should not affect the government's decision on whether 21st Century Fox should be allowed to buy Sky.\n\n\n\"Fox News has breached Ofcom's rules over and over again, so 21st Century Fox clearly thought it was easier to pull it from the UK altogether than to clean up its act,\" Watson said.\n\n\"But the ongoing corporate governance and sexual harassment scandal at Fox News is still deeply relevant to the question of whether 21st Century Fox should be allowed to take over Sky, whether the channel is broadcast here or not.\"\n\nFox News was taken off air between 5am and 11pm on election day to avoid any issues with Ofcom.\n\nUK fans of Fox News will not be able to turn to the internet to watch the channel as it is not streamed online. Only clips of Fox News programming are available online.\n\nSky, which is 39% controlled by 21st Century Fox, continues to fund Sky News, which loses tens of millions of pounds a year.\n\nEd Miliband, the former Labour leader and long-time Murdoch critic, said: \"This decision shows the Murdochs panicking about their bid for Sky. It amounts to an admission that despite having broadcast here year after year, Fox News is not fit for UK broadcasting in the standards and ethics of its journalism. It's yet more proof that the Murdochs can't be trusted to own 100% of Sky.\n\n\"Stopping broadcasting in the UK changes nothing. Fox News in the US is the Murdochs' channel, they are responsible for its broadcasting standards and the appalling racial and sexual harassment that happened on their watch. The Murdochs can't run from their record at Fox News.\""}

In the show's monologue, the stars of the upcoming film The Interview\u2014the production that is suspected to be the impetus behind the attack\u2014shared photos that they jokingly claimed has been been stolen from their phones, and a good laugh was had by all.\n\nWell, maybe not all. It's safe to say that Sony and its employees aren't amused by the situation. In addition to 47,000 social security numbers and uncomfortable salary information, the breach is alleged to include details as personal as one executive's breastfeeding details. The hackers say they have 100 terabytes of data which they claim they will release if Sony doesn't comply with their demand to stop the release of The Interview, in which Franco and Rogen play journalists recruited by the CIA to assassinate North Korean despot Kim Jong-un.\n\nIt remains unclear who executed the attack, but as this Reuters graphic makes clear, there is no shortage of bad actors. According to Akamai's quarterly State of the Internet report, the biggest source of attacks in the second quarter of this year was China, with 43 percent of attacks originating there\u2014almost triple the 15 percent being launched from second-place Indonesia. And U.S. cyberspace is no haven either: 13 percent of attacks were reported to have been based from American IP addresses.\n\nWhile some former Sony employees are contemplating a class action lawsuit, North Korea continues to deny involvement, instead suggesting that its supporters (North Korea has supporters?) were behind the \"righteous attack.\" Whoever it was, the mere scope of the stolen data means that this could be a headache for Sony for a long time to come."}

After dabbling with business-focused features for a while, Dropbox is now officially launching Dropbox for Business, with tools designed to make the service as convenient as possible for IT managers.\n\nDropbox for Business is really the rechristened Dropbox for Teams, which the company launched back in 2011. That service costs $795 a year for 1TB of storage and includes live support as well as many team-management tools. With Dropbox for Business, the service is getting single sign-on (SSO).\n\nWith SSO, IT managers will be able to let their company's employees sign into Dropbox with the same login info they use for all company services. It also means easier management of those with access to Dropbox folders, since SSO will be tied to active directory integration. If a company deletes someone from their main directory, that change will automatically be reflected in Dropbox.\n\nSEE ALSO: Dropbox Tips for Wizards, Intermediates & Beginners\n\n\"Opportunities have opened up to work with larger and larger businesses,\" says Dropbox vice president of business development Sujay Jaswa. \"Based on our conversations with these customers, the most requested feature was single sign-on.\"\n\nFor the new service, Dropbox has partnered with several sign-on identity providers, namely Ping Identity, Okta, OneLogin, Centrify and Symplified. Dropbox's SSO uses Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), an industry standard.\n\n\"Most businesses tend to already have an existing identity provider,\" says Dropbox for Business manager Anand Subramani. \"From the admin perspective, if you set this up correctly, the user may actually never even have to log into Dropbox. We can securely pass your credentials from your PC to Dropbox.\"\n\nBesides adding an IT-friendly feature (at no extra cost), Dropbox for Business also represents the company unquestionably entering the enterprise market, going head-to-head with others in the space such as Box.net.\n\n\"SSO using SAML is clearly an enterprise feature,\" says Jaswa. \"But our customers now range all the way from small businesses to divisions of large companies, and several large companies are talking to us about much larger deployments, and we wanted to come up a name that adequately reflected our customer base.\"\n\nWill your business consider using Dropbox now that it has single sign-on?

{"id": 259249, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "I consider myself quasi-Chareidi, but live in a mixed community with people across the religious spectrum. My next door neighbor and best friend is someone who certainly wouldn't be classified as Chareidi, and yet somehow, we manage to be very close friends. I admire her and respect her and think she is a wonderful woman, even if our values are not always the same, and I hope she can say the same about me.\n\nThe way our friendship works is that we take turns listening to each other speak, try to hear where the other person is coming from, try to understand how they feel, even if it is diametrically opposed to what we hold dear. And sometimes we try to convince each other of our opinion, and sometimes it works, but more often than not, it doesn't. So we have our very different opinions, agree to disagree, and move on to more important things.\n\nThe reason it works is that at the basis of our friendship is an undercurrent of respect. We know that the other person is not a nasty person, but truly has a good heart, wanting to do the right thing, even if we may not agree on what that thing is. That alone is the foundation for respect, and how we manage to be good friends, despite differences in some of our core beliefs.\n\nI suspect that our friendship is not unique. There are many people who manage to be good friends despite having different values, even about very important things. Most mature people have disagreements about many subjects with their friends and acquaintances, but try to find a common ground for their relationship.\n\nAnd yet, when there are groups of people with different core values, all this often flies out the window.\n\nI just read an article about this very topic\u2013 in which the author challenged people on both sides of the Women of the Wall issue to \"empathize with the other side and acknowledge their right to have their opinions.\"\n\nI decided that, as the founder of Women For The Wall, an organization whose purpose, in part, is to stand up for the opposite of what the Women of the Wall stand for, keeping tradition and status quo at the Kotel, I would take up the writer on her challenge, and in the spirit of Lag BaOmer, where the message seems to be one of unity and Ahavat Yisrael, and reach out to you, the Women of the Wall, as a gesture of friendship.\n\nFirst off, I wanted to get back to my friend, that I mentioned above. She and I have irreconcilable differences, but we manage to be friends because instead of looking at what divides us, we try to focus on what we have in common. I think the reason why people fighting for causes tend to fight and be nasty towards each other is because when there are organizations, there tend to be anonymous entities, so it's hard to see past the differences and look for the common ground. Organizations standing up to organizations tend to dehumanize things- we tend to forget there are people behind these organizations, fighting for these causes.\n\nI was reading some articles tonight about the Women of the Wall and all of a sudden, a name stuck out at me- Cheryl Mack- one of the board members of the Women of the Wall.\n\nAll of a sudden, Women of the Wall had a very real face for me.\n\nYou see, I've known Cheryl for a very, very long time. In fact, I don't even know how old I was when I met her- I was a very little kid- my dad was good friends with her husband- they davened together in shul, my mother good friends with her, and they and their kids would come over to our house on many Shabbatot; we had many meals together. We fell out of touch when my family moved to Israel, but Cheryl and I bumped into each other a few times on the streets of Jerusalem where we spoke and caught up, updating each other on our families and our current lives.\n\nI know for a fact that Cheryl is a very caring, wonderful woman with a heart of gold. I know for a fact that she is a truth seeker and always tries to help people.\n\nAnd I know that with her a board member of Women of the Wall, and myself a founder of Women For The Wall, we stand on opposite ends of a chasm of religious differences, but now I see we have a bridge connecting the two ends- our mutual quest for truth, and desire to help people.\n\nNow that I'm more aware of the role Cheryl plays in your organization, dearest members of the Women of the Wall, I call out to you:\n\nDear sisters,\n\nWe live in a country surrounded by people who want to kill us, and we're at each other's throats because of differences of beliefs? Why does it have to be that way? Why can't we be like my friend and I- with"}

It was strange moving out of David's luxurious penthouse, but I know that it's for the best. I still miss him, even though I have no regrets about leaving him and breaking our engagement. The relationship, while convenient and comfortable, wasn't healthy for either of us.\n\nI became complacent, happy to live my life as Mrs. David Wayne. The ambitions I had grown up with fell by the wayside as our relationship grew more serious. I want to be more than just someone's wife, I want to make a name for myself on my own.\n\nOur relationship had a much more devastating effect on David's well-being. He became obsessed with whether or not I was being faithful to him, even though there has never been anyone else since we started seeing each other. A man would glance at me on the street, and David would try to pick a fight with him! Near the end, I don't think he believed that I even loved him. Breaking off the engagement gives us both the space we need to become who we should be.\n\nIt's late, so I tidy up in the kitchen and make my way to my bedroom. I change for the night into a loose-fitting nightgown, brush my teeth, and head to bed.\n\n[WonderfulSin]\n\nIf there was one way to describe David, Napoleon Complex would suit him best. His personality wasn't much to speak of, and his ill temper and short stature certainly did not add any appeal. You could argue that a woman could be swayed into a relationship with him on his vast fortunes alone, but his wealth was something that hardly deserved bragging in and of itself. His money was purely inherited from his father, this guy never having worked a day in his life. Of course I wasn't dating the guy, so his story hardly mattered to me. He was just a client, and this woman of his was just another target.\n\nBefore I could even get a word in edgewise when we had met, he ranted and raved on for what seemed like an eternity about you. Vile whore, shameless slut, filthy floozy, every insult he could conceive was tossed around before the price was set. Said price being ten million dollars. It was always amusing to me, the prices people would pay to end the lives of others, far more interesting than their reasons. 'I'll give you this many sheets of green paper to permanently etch out a human being' just sounds silly no matter how you slice it. But I wasn't exactly a man of morals, of a hitman's code of honor, or someone who pondered the conundrums of philosophy. I just did what paid the bills and excited me. And in the case of David Wayne desiring the death of a Miss Anna, my bills were paid and my life was excited by a very clear and concise instruction on behalf of Mr. Wayne: 'Don't let it be quick'.\n\nAnd that brought me, on this fine night, to a little apartment in a quiet part of the city, a place nearly devoid of all tenants. Prior research of the place showed that only you and a little over half a dozen others lived here, the building strangely empty for who knows why. Well, less people around is always a good thing for me, making my job go along much smoother. The lock to your apartment was simple and dated, incredibly easy to figure out. In under a minutes time I had successfully made my way inside, further relieved that there appeared to be no unexpected company with you tonight.

(0:30)\n\nEditor's note: This story was originally published before the Redskins and Cousins failed to work out a long-term deal by Monday's deadline.\n\nThe Washington Redskins may not know how good they have it.\n\nAs the team attempts to lock up quarterback Kirk Cousins to a long-term deal, the rhetoric emanating from the NFC East franchise suggests a belief that their signal-caller is merely an above-average passer. The numbers say that's selling him short.\n\n\"Kirk has proven he's in the top 15 quarterbacks,\" Doug Williams, now the Redskins' senior vice president of player personnel, said recently. The comment wasn't meant as a slight (and may have been a negotiating tactic), as Williams has indicated that he certainly wants to lock Cousins up to a new deal.\n\nFormer general manager Scot McCloughan indicated in May that he felt Cousins had reached his ceiling and that the quarterback needed to be surrounded by other talent. Though McCloughan is now out of the picture, his sentiment appears to be a popular perception of Cousins -- a solid but unremarkable quarterback. The advanced metrics paint a different picture, one of an upper-tier passer who probably deserves the higher compensation he seeks.\n\nYou like that? The Redskins apparently can't decide, despite data suggesting they should lock up Kirk Cousins. Kamil Krzaczynski/USA TODAY Sports\n\nDespite a two-interception performance in a Week 17 loss to the New York Giants that cost the Redskins a playoff berth -- more evidence for Cousins' detractors that he's prone to the late pick -- he finished the 2016 season with a Total QBR of 71.7, sixth best in the league. It was not a fluke: He finished in the exact same position the year before. Over the course of 2015 and 2016 combined, QBR ranked him fourth, behind only Dak Prescott (in a one-year sample), Tom Brady and Matt Ryan. To repeat: A two-year sample and Cousins was safely in the company of Brady, Ryan and arguably the best rookie quarterback season in history. People get paid for less.\n\nThough there are some instances when analytics reveal hidden talents, the reality is that much of Cousins' abilities have been viewable in plain sight: He was the leader of the offense that recorded the second-most passing yards in 2016 while throwing for the third-most yards per attempt (8.1) among quarterbacks.\n\nTotal QBR is not the only advanced metric indicating that Cousins is better than the level Williams referenced. In Football Outsiders' DVOA, Cousins ranked sixth and fifth, respectively, among quarterbacks in 2015 and 2016. He finished eighth and fourth, respectively, in those two years in Pro Football Reference's adjusted net yards per attempt as well.\n\nCertainly, there were a couple of specific areas in which Cousins excelled, as would likely be the case for any quarterback to rank so highly in QBR. Most notably, the Redskins quarterback leaned more heavily on, and had more success with, the deep ball in 2016. Though he finished fourth in raw QBR (which does not adjust for quality of opponent) on passes that traveled 21 or more yards in the air in 2016, he did so on the second-most attempts (69) and therefore contributed more expected points (24.55) on those types of passes than any other quarterback in the league. Ben Roethlisberger ranked second in the category, finishing with 20.57 expected points added on those throws.\n\nWhile QBR does try to isolate the quarterback's impact on each play, it is worth noting that part of the reason Cousins had the opportunity to throw that many passes downfield is because he had DeSean Jackson on his team. Jackson had the second-most targets (30) and receptions (14) on passes that traveled 21-plus yards in the air last year and ranked third in air yards per target. Cousins will not have the benefit of throwing to Jackson again this season, as the receiver bolted in free agency for Tampa Bay, though Terrelle Pryor Sr. -- 10th in air yards per target last year with far inferior quarterbacks throwing to him -- was signed in his stead.\n\nAdditionally, Cousins was at his best, relative to other quarterbacks, when not under pressure, leading the league in 2015 and finishing fourth in 2016 in raw QBR when not under duress. Of course, the flip side of Cousins' success when not under pressure is that he was particularly poor with it. He ranked 30th and 21st in raw QBR when under pressure in 2015 and 2016, respectively, and 17th and 16th when facing five or more pass-rushers in the same time period. Interestingly, opponents did not overly capitalize on this relative weakness, as Cousins was blitzed on only 24.6 percent of dropbacks (16th most) in 2016.\n\nNonetheless, if the Redskins"}

{"id": 259258, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Here's the rub: when you load JavaScript from a third party you should do it asynchronously. You might want to load your own scripts asynchronously too, but for this article let's focus on third parties.\n\nThere are two reasons for this:\n\nIf the third-party goes down or is slow, your page won't be held up trying to load that resource. It can speed up page loads.\n\nAt Wufoo, we just switched over to an asynchronous embed snippet. Users who build forms with Wufoo and want to embed them on their site are now recommended to use it. We did it for exactly those reasons above. It's the responsible thing to do for a web service that asks people to link to resources on that services site.\n\nLet's explore this whole async thing.\n\nUhm. What?\n\nThere is a little terminology involved here that will help us understand the umbrella \"asynchronous\" term.\n\n\"Parser blocking\" - The browser reads your HTML and when it comes to a <script> it downloads that entire resource before moving on with the parsing. This definitely slows down page loads, especially if the script is in the head or above any other visual elements. This is true in older browsers as well as modern browsers if you don't use the async attribute (more on that later). From the MDN docs: \"In older browsers that don't support the async attribute, parser-inserted scripts block the parser...\"\n\nTo prevent problematic parser blocking, scripts can be \"script inserted\" (i.e. insert another script with JavaScript) which then forces them to execute asynchronously (except in Opera or pre 4.0 Firefox).\n\n\"Resource blocking\" - While a script is being downloaded, it can prevent other resources from downloading at the same time as it. IE 6 and 7 do this, only allowing one script to be downloaded at a time and nothing else. IE 8 and Safari 4 allow multiple scripts to download in parallel, but block any other resources (reference).\n\nIdeally we fight against both of these problems and speed up page loading (both actual and perceived) speed.\n\nThe HTML5 Way\n\nThere is an async attribute for the script tag in HTML5 (spec). Example:\n\n<script async src=\"https://third-party.com/resource.js\"></script>\n\nThe browser support for it is Firefox 3.6+, IE 10+, Chrome 2+, Safari 5+, iOS 5+, Android 3+. No Opera support yet.\n\nIf you are going to load a script directly like that, using this attribute is probably a good idea. It prevents parser blocking. These newer browsers don't have any big problems with resource blocking, but the parser thing is a big deal. We aren't using this at Wufoo because we need way deeper browser support than that.\n\nThe Classic Async Way\n\nHere is the basic async script loading pattern that will get you as deep of browser support as you'd ever need:\n\n<script> var resource = document.createElement('script'); resource.src = \"https://third-party.com/resource.js\"; var script = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; script.parentNode.insertBefore(resource, script); </script>\n\nHere's a more efficient version with a wrapper around those variables (credit Mathias Bynens):\n\n(function(d, t) { var g = d.createElement(t), s = d.getElementsByTagName(t)[0]; g.src = 'https://third-party.com/resource.js'; s.parentNode.insertBefore(g, s); }(document, 'script'));\n\nUpdate: Note that this is async attribute. Note that this is no longer recommended! The era that made this a useful pattern is over, and you should mostly just use theattribute.\n\nAd Networks\n\nBuySellAds is an advertising network that was one of the first to deliver ads asynchronously. This is their pattern:\n\n<script type=\"text/javascript\"> (function(){ var bsa = document.createElement('script'); bsa.type = 'text/javascript'; bsa.async = true; bsa.src = 'https://s3.buysellads.com/ac/bsa.js'; (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]||document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(bsa); })(); </script>\n\nCouple of things to note here:\n\nThey are setting the async attribute of the script to true before appending it. This is useful exclusively for Firefox 3.6 which is the only browser that doesn't do that by default. This can probably be omitted in most scenarios. Setting the"}

Taking the time to properly prepare your Metasploit Lab Environment will help eliminate many problems before they arise later in the course. We highly recommend using a system that is capable of running multiple virtual machines to host your labs.\n\nMetasploit Unleashed Hardware Requirements\n\nAll of the values listed below are estimated or recommended. You can get away with less in some cases but be aware that performance will suffer, making for a less than ideal learning experience.\n\nHard Drive Space\n\nYou will need to have, at minimum, 10 gigabytes of available storage space on your host. Since we are using virtual machines with large file sizes, this means that we are unable to use a FAT32 partition since large files are not supported in that filesystem, so be sure to choose NTFS, ext3, or some other filesystem format. The recommended amount of space needed is 30 gigabytes.\n\nIf you decided to create clones or snapshots of your virtual machine(s) as you progress through the course, these will also take up valuable space on your system. Be vigilant and do not be afraid to reclaim space as needed.\n\nAvailable Memory\n\nFailing to provide enough memory to your host and guest operating systems will eventually lead to system failure and/or result in being unable to launch your virtual machine(s). You are going to require RAM for your host OS as well as the amount of RAM that you are dedicating for each virtual machine. Use the guide below to help in deciding the amount of RAM required for your situation.\n\nLinux \"HOST\" Minimal Memory Requirements\n\n1 GB of system memory (RAM)\n\n\nRealistically 2 GB or more\n\nKali \"GUEST\" Minimal Memory Requirements\n\nAt least 1 GB of RAM (2 GB is recommended) // more never hurts!\n\n\nRealistically 2 GB or more with a SWAP file of equal value\n\nMetasploitable \"GUEST\" Minimal Memory Requirements\n\nAt least 256 MB of RAM (512 MB is recommended) // more never hurts!\n\n(Optional) Per Windows \"GUEST\" Minimal Memory Requirements\n\nAt least 256 MB of RAM (1 GB is recommended) // more never hurts!\n\n\nRealistically 1 GB or more with a page file of equal value\n\nProcessor\n\nTo ensure the best experience, we recommend a 64-bit quad-core CPU or better. The bare-minimum requirement for VMware Player is a 400MHz or faster processor (500MHz recommended) but these speeds are inadequate for the purposes of this course. The more horsepower you can throw at your lab, the better.\n\nInternet Accessibility\n\nGetting your lab set up will require downloading some large virtual machines so you will want to have a good high-speed connection to do so. If you choose to use \"Bridged\" networking for your virtual machines and there is no DHCP server on your network, you will have to assign static IP addresses to your guest VMs.\n\nMetasploit Unleashed Software Requirements\n\nBefore jumping in to the Metasploit Framework, we will need to have both an attacking machine (Kali Linux) and a victim machine (metasploitable 2) as well as a hypervisor to run both in a safe and secluded network environment.\n\nHypervisor\n\nOur recommended hypervisor for the best out-of-the-box compatibility with Kali and metasploitable is VMware Player. While VMware Player is \"free\", you will have to register in order to download it, and the virtualization applications and appliances are well worth the registration if you do not already have an account. You may also use VMware Workstation or VMware Fusion but neither of these is free.\n\nThere are also other options available when it comes to which hypervisor you would like to use. In addition to VMware, two other commonly used hypervisors are VirtualBox and KVM but they are not covered here. Instructions for installing Kali Linux can be found on the Kali Training site.\n\nKali Linux\n\nKali Linux is an advanced Penetration Testing and Security Auditing Linux distribution that will be used throughout this course. Kali Linux comes with Metasploit pre-installed along with numerous other security tools that you can try out against your victim machine. You can download the latest version of Kali at:\n\nOnce you have downloaded Kali, you can update Metasploit to the latest version in the repos by running apt update && apt upgrade in a terminal.\n\nMetasploitable\n\nOne of the problems you encounter when learning how to use an exploitation framework is trying to find and configure targets to scan and attack.

REUTERS/Adrees Latif\n\nMcCrory, a Republican, faced intense lobbying from pro-choice advocates who hoped he would veto the measure, citing his campaign promise not to sign any further restrictions on abortion.\n\nBut in a statement released late Wednesday, McCrory said that the final version of the bill met his approval. He noted that he had worked with legislators to ensure that initial contact made with a health care provider could be a phone call, so the law would not require separate office visits.\n\n\"Some very positive progress was made during the last several days to protect women's health,\" McCrory said. \"Therefore, I will sign this bill.\"\n\nOnce the measure becomes law, North Carolina will join Missouri, South Dakota and Utah in requiring a 72-hour waiting period. Last month, Oklahoma also adopted a 72-hour waiting period. A total of 24 states require some waiting period before an abortion can be performed, and several are considering new or longer restrictions this year.\n\nNorth Carolina's bill triples the state's current 24-hour waiting period. McCrory's vow to sign it came after the state House of Representatives gave its final approval, agreeing to slightly modified form that passed the Senate on Monday. The house initially approved the bill in April. All three votes fell largely along party lines.\n\nProtesters rallied on Wednesday in Raleigh and in Charlotte, where McCrory was once mayor, to urge a veto. At one rally, the side of a truck bore McCrory's image alongside his campaign promise.\n\nCritics noted that McCrory signed into law a previous measure tightening regulation of abortion clinics. In a statement urging McCrory to veto the waiting period bill, Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said he was being given \"a second chance to make good on his promise not to interfere with women's access to safe, legal, essential health care.\"\n\n\"No one should be forced to delay health care because politicians have the audacity to presume to know what is best for a woman and her family,\" said Northup, whose organization advocates for abortion rights, in a statement."}

I could hardly believe how evil he was.\"\n\n\nPetiot had taken warped advantage of the horrors of war to unleash his own murderous reign of terror.\n\n\nHe claimed to run a secret network which offered safe passage to South America via Portugal.\n\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nCYANIDE\n\n\nCharging 25,000 francs from each \"refugee\", he told them to arrive at his home with their most valuable possessions packed in their luggage.\n\nPolice later found 49 empty suitcases at his home.\n\nThey were persuaded to write a letter to their relatives which stated they were now safely in Argentina but any more further contact would be dangerous.\n\n\nHe then informed them that Argentina required inoculations, and led them to a triangular room, where he injected some with cyanide.\n\nThrough a peep-hole in the wall, he would watch them die.\n\n\nOther victims would be gassed with Zyklon B \u2013 which was used by the Nazis to kill millions in concentration camps.\n\n\nPetiot even went to some of the victims' houses to steal their furniture, informing neighbours it was part of the deal.\n\n\nIn all, Petiot is believed to have stolen 200million francs from his victims \u2013 around \u00a315million today.\n\n\nAt first he dumped the bodies in the River Seine, or threw plastic sacks of body parts into passing trucks.\n\nBy August 1942, Parisians were aware a murderer was at large.\n\n\nA police report detailed a macabre discovery in a truck. It read: \"Two human heads without skin or fingertips, two feet with no toenails, skin of two legs including heel and three scalps, the first with reddish blonde hair, the second almost black, and the third grey.\"\n\n\nAmong the dead was a family of three German Jews who escaped Paris' largest mass round-up by the Nazis. In July 1942, 13,000 disappeared in 48 hours.\n\n\nKurt and Margaret Kneller and their seven-year-old son Rene hid in a neighbour's house before approaching their family doctor.\n\n\nMr King says: \"This case shocked me, because it was a family and Petiot had been their doctor for years. Petiot took their money and got their son to take a photo for his fake passport.\n\nHe later turned up at their home and took all their furniture.\n\n\n\"Two months after they had survived the Nazis, their dismembered remains were fished out of the Seine.\"\n\n\nBetween 1942 and 1943, nine heads, four thighs and numerous other pieces were recovered from the river"}

Add-on warranty providers know we're attached to our gadgets. Who am I kidding? Breaking a phone is like losing a dear friend.\n\nBut here's the cold reality: Most extended warranties like AppleCare, or those from Asurion and SquareTrade, for broken, lost or stolen electronics are a bad deal. And in some cases, they're a downright rip-off.\n\nInsurance makes sense on the big things in life, like your house or your health. The cost of fixing either can be astronomical. But the pain of repairing consumer electronics\u2014even pricey ones like a laptop\u2014is still relatively limited.\n\nExtended gadget warranties are only worth it for niche cases, like people with an extremely advanced case of klutziness. Programs like AppleCare can also be helpful to those who need always-on-call phone tech support, beyond the great free service Apple AAPL 1.30% offers.\n\nYet for most of us, here's a better plan from Richard Thaler, a renowned economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business: \"Every time someone offers to sell you insurance on a non-large purchase say no, and take that money and put it into a rainy-day account. With any luck, there will be plenty of money in that account the next time you drop your iPhone.\"\n\nOr, take the money and buy yourself a nice protective case.\n\nAn Apple spokesman says AppleCare programs deliver \"exceptional value by giving our customers access to unmatched tech support wherever they need it, extending coverage for hardware repairs and protecting against the most common types of accidental damage.\"\n\nApple says AppleCare not only extends customer warranties, it also provides more comprehensive service and support.\n\nBehavioral economists like Prof. Thaler say add-on warranties only seem like a good idea because it's hard to do the right mental accounting. When a purchase brings us joy, we naturally worry about the cost of a repair or replacement, research shows. But underwriters focus on a different stat: the likelihood that something will actually go wrong.\n\nThe warranty companies have those numbers, and make an art out of charging enough for their plans that they still make a killing. It's hard for us to figure out the chances of an incident, but in general, gadgets are getting more reliable, not less.\n\nIf you have experience tinkering with electronics, one option is to buy a replacement screen and fix an iPhone yourself. Photo: Emily Prapuolenis/The Wall Street Journal\n\nA few data points nod to the risks. Smartphones that live in back pockets and sweaty palms are perhaps more vulnerable to accidental destruction than TVs and laptops. A repair firm called iCracked that offers a warranty program told me that 20% of customers with an iPhone 6 crack the screen within a year of buying. SquareTrade, another warranty firm, says a third of its mobile phone customers file a claim at some point. A good case would likely reduce your risk, but I've not seen any data on the subject.\n\nConsumer Reports, which generally recommends avoiding extended warranties, says only 15% of buyers got a new phone because the old one broke, and only 2% because it was lost or stolen, based on a reader survey.\n\nIf you do crack your phone, many warranties don't look like a great deal when you tally the cost of a fix. Any iPhone owner can walk into an Apple store or authorized repair center and have an iPhone 6 screen fixed for $109. You might have to wait, but there's no extended warranty required.\n\nWith AppleCare+, even after you shell out $99 up front, Apple asks for an additional $79 deductible to fix broken screens. Your total out-of-pocket for a broken screen expense is $178\u2014and you're only allowed two accidents in the life of your phone. (AppleCare also covers a battery replacement without the deductible.)\n\nIf you don't live near an Apple store\u2014or you just like being self-reliant and have at least some experience tinkering with electronics\u2014you could also just repair the broken screen yourself. I was able to replace the screen on a broken iPhone using a $110 kit from iCracked in about two hours. (Tech companies profit by making us think we can't repair our own gadgets, but honestly, it's just a bunch of tiny screws.)\n\nSay something really bad happens to your phone, like it takes a swan dive into the loo. Worst-case scenario, the most Apple ever charges to repair an iPhone 6 is $299\u2014again, without needing their insurance.\n\nMy family used to always buy AppleCare on more expensive purchases, like we did on a 2012 MacBook Pro with Retina display.

{"id": 259271, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutra's community.\n\nThe thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.\n\nSo, here we go. My first entry at Gamasutra. Guess what: I've been lurking for ages now, always thinking about what I could add in terms of value content. I have a few ideas in mind and at some point I'll most likely explore 'em. But there has been a discussion over at Kotaku where I'd say it is worth to talk a bit about: What do games cost?\n\nIn said article the author said that video games are expensive to produce, because every person costs a development studio roughly 10.000 Dollar. And suddenly people were yelling that gamedevs could be more efficient (which I'd agree on at some point for sure) and that developers earn way too much. Yes, there have been other comments too, also from fellow industry veterans, explaining the numbers a bit more. And I'd like to step in here and explain thing even more. Because the numbers are wrong. And they are also right. Wait? What?\n\nAlright. What does a game cost? It depends on a lot of factors.\n\nFirst of all: Yes, 10.000 Dollar sounds like a realistic number. In some areas. Which brings us to a super important factor. The location. Where is the studio located? Is it located in the United States? In that case the number is quite realistic. Here, in Germany, people usually do the math with around 5.000 Euro, which roughly translates into 6.000 Dollar. In Eastern Europe it is less. In China as well. It really depends on where a studio is located. Also: Not each studio (or every publisher) pays equally. For some studios in the States it might be 9.000 Dollar per Man Month. For some it might be 12.000 Dollar.\n\nBut okay, still, developers earn shitloads of money, don't they? I mean, they must be swimming in cash each morning before they go to work, right? Wrong. Sadly that's not the case. Honestly, hardly anyone gets rich in the industry. Of course, there are people who get rich. But believe me: Most don't and never will. Not everyone has the luck to produce the next Flappy Bird. They don't get 60.000 Dollar per year.\n\nWait? They don't? Yep. They don't. The numbers which are currently in the discussion are not the salary of an employee but the cost factor the studio has per employee. That includes licenses for programs (Photoshop anyone?), rent for space (and you usually need to have a good location, cause employees are happier if they can actually get to work easily), the working equipment (which reminds me, my machine could use a new processor), insurances (yep, thieves are real and shit can happen), wage labor costs (damn you taxes, right?) and so on. I don't know the numbers for the States but in Germany the wage labor costs are around 30 \u2013 40% I think (to be honest here, I haven't double checked that. Since I am not a company myself, I luckily do not have to deal with these things but I know that the costs are quite high and I think it still works as an explanation without knowing the exact numbers). That means: Quite a lot of the money is not used for the employee directly, but to actually employ him or her.\n\nIt has to be added that not every employee earns the same. Programmers do not earn the same as Artists do not earn the same as Testers do not earn the same as Designers. All the sums here are not actual numbers but just an average number. And that might not be even based on the games industry only but the society in general. And if it was my Company, I'd also add some kind of buffer on top, to make sure I'd be able to pay the bills even if things got tricky.\n\nIn the Kotaku discussion I've also read lots of interesting comments about saving money during development. I found at least one comment which brought me close to a facepalm. The comment was about the QA, the quality assurance. It was suggested to get rid of the QA and use Betatests instead. Honestly? That won't work. Each Closed Alpha, Open Alpha, Closed Beta and Open Beta is usually tested upfront. Believe me if I say you wouldn't enjoy such a build if it wasn't. Getting rid of the quality assurance would not be a good idea.\n\nAlso: If you are a Indie and / or work in your spare time and / or from your home, it changes the variables of course.\n\nBut the question is, what does a game cost in the end? You can do the math on your own now. The rule is rather easy"}

Effective date.\n\nTITLE III--MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS\n\nSec. 301. Severability.\n\nSec. 302. Child labor protections.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\nCongress makes the following findings:\n\n(1) Deciphering the sequence of the human genome and other advances in genetics open major new opportunities for medical progress. New knowledge about the genetic basis of illness will allow for earlier detection of illnesses, often before symptoms have begun. Genetic testing can allow individuals to take steps to reduce the likelihood that they will contract a particular disorder. New knowledge about genetics may allow for the development of better therapies that are more effective against disease or have fewer side effects than current treatments. These advances give rise to the potential misuse of genetic information to discriminate in health insurance and employment. (2) The early science of genetics became the basis of State laws that provided for the sterilization of persons having presumed genetic \ufffddefects\ufffd such as mental retardation, mental disease, epilepsy, blindness, and hearing loss, among other conditions. The first sterilization law was enacted in the State of Indiana in 1907. By 1981, a majority of States adopted sterilization laws to \ufffdcorrect\ufffd apparent genetic traits or tendencies. Many of these State laws have since been repealed, and many have been modified to include essential constitutional requirements of due process and equal protection. However, the current explosion in the science of genetics, and the history of sterilization laws by the States based on early genetic science, compels Congressional action in this area. (3) Although genes are facially neutral markers, many genetic conditions and disorders are associated with particular racial and ethnic groups and gender. Because some genetic traits are most prevalent in particular groups, members of a particular group may be stigmatized or discriminated against as a result of that genetic information. This form of discrimination was evident in the 1970s, which saw the advent of programs to screen and identify carriers of sickle cell anemia, a disease which afflicts African-Americans. Once again, State legislatures began to enact discriminatory laws in the area, and in the early 1970s began mandating genetic screening of all African Americans for sickle cell anemia, leading to discrimination and unnecessary fear. To alleviate some of this stigma, Congress in 1972 passed the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control Act, which withholds Federal funding from States unless sickle cell testing is voluntary. (4) Congress has been informed of examples of genetic discrimination in the workplace. These include the use of pre- employment genetic screening at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, which led to a court decision in favor of the employees in that case Norman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (135 F.3d 1260, 1269 (9th Cir. 1998)). Congress clearly has a compelling public interest in relieving the fear of discrimination and in prohibiting its actual practice in employment and health insurance. (5) Federal law addressing genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment is incomplete in both the scope and depth of its protections. Moreover, while many States have enacted some type of genetic non-discrimination law, these laws vary widely with respect to their approach, application, and level of protection. Congress has collected substantial evidence"}

If not, feel free to skip it:)\n\nSit down with your contractor and discuss the rules of your house. Be sure he/she understands the importance of these rules. Print them out. Post them all over your house.\n\n1. Staging the work. The way a construction project should occur while living in the house is staging the job such that there is always a liveable area of the house. This means that rooms under construction should be partitioned by a thick plastic barrier at the very least. This is especially important if your home was built before 1978, because of EPA lead paint testing requirements (Fulcrum Properties entirely ignored this one). Super thin painters' drop cloth grade plastic will not do the trick as we found out while working with Fulcrum. Vents should be covered such that dust is not traveling to different rooms all over the house. Although our kitchen was not under construction, this picture is how I found my stove many nights during the project. I would have to clean my kitchen over and over and over again. And this is not what we were promised. But that old scope of work didn't specify this, we had only discussed this at length verbally. Again, don't make this mistake.\n\n2. Wood floors need to be protected at the beginning of the job. Our floors were not covered until the very end stages of the project. Workman walked in the backyard with their dirty boots and construction debris and then walked right into our house. When moving furniture, the floors were not protected. We have huge three foot scratch marks where an armoire was moved. At the tail end of the project Fulcrum placed plastic on our stairs and paper on our floors, but that did little good. We've learned from other contractors that you need to place wood down on wood to truly protect it. In the end, we had to have our floors refinished, and trust me that it was a fight to have our contractor pay for it.\n\n3. Close and lock the doors. This may seem kind of silly, but we only bring it up because Fulcrum had a hard time with this one. I worked from home for quite a bit during the construction project, I had to get up every few minutes or what felt like every few minutes to close the door to the 30 degree winter weather outside. The workers just couldn't close doors after themselves, another indicator that they were used to working in vacant homes, not when a family lived in one. When I went into the office, I would come home to the doors unlocked and wide open, in the winter. And this was during a time where a string of robberies occurred in our neighborhood. I would be with my children and wonder. \"had I just been robbed, was I being robbed right now? Why were the doors wide open in the winter, much less unlocked?\" Not a contractor in sight.\n\n4. Protect your furniture. Fulcrum rarely protected our furniture and if they did, they used a painter grade thin plastic to do so. Because of this, we experienced damage to a cherished buffet, a chair from my childhood, a glass coffee table, and a vase from our wedding. This goes back to the idea of staging. So if construction will occur in a room, a contractor needs to let the owner know or prepare the room for the construction, but something needs to be communicated. We assumed, wrongly, that Fulcrum would protect our things that were too heavy for us to move. We moved most everything else out of the way, minus the vase. Be sure you are on the same page with your contractor on this one as much of the damage we experienced can't be repaired.\n\n5. Other. Microwave use, smoking, using the bathroom. Decide how you feel about contractors using your microwave, smoking in your yard and disposing of the butts on your lawn, using your bathroom. These are all personal choices that need to be communicated with your contractor. Again, this seems terribly silly doesn't it, but talk about it and put it in writing."}

How to approach the\n\nconstruction of a command, how to store data, how to retrieve it, and how\n\nto cope with a set of commands that all work on the same data have been\n\ncovered in this series of tutorials. What I'm going to do now is give you\n\none method for how to make an IC time system.\n\nPreviously, we'd done a multiple-item vendor, which is for many\n\ncoders the jumping-off point as far as skills and projects go. Once you\n\nhave something that works locally, the next logical step is to make things\n\nthat work globally. While I don't think I'll get to every standard code\n\nsystem that is used in these lessons, I want to show you some of the\n\nthings I can do and hope that from there, you'll know enough to go out on\n\nyour own and do your own stuff.\n\nThis lesson is going to be written a trifle differently than the\n\nprevious five, because if you have read them, worked through the examples,\n\nand understood what I was talking about(no small task, particularly the\n\nlast part.), you are going to have a more than functional lexicon of code\n\nknowledge. This lets me skim over a few of the general elements of the\n\ncode logic I will present, and focus on some of the more precise details.\n\nWhat this means for you is that if you either a) don't have a\n\nsolid grasp of what mushcode is, b) found this link in a websearch, or c)\n\nyou're currently quite chemically inconvenienced...this is going to make\n\nlittle to no sense to you. I suggest that you read at least lessons one,\n\ntwo, and three, as those lay out the fundamental principles by which I\n\ncode, and give you a sense of how I build commands and u-functions.\n\nThe topic of this lesson is going to be the construction of an IC\n\ntime system, that works on a faster-than-RL time scale. The one I am going\n\nto show you how to build has been used, successfully, on ten mushes so\n\nfar, and easily accomodates a 2:1, 3:1, or higher(yipes) timescale. This\n\nparticular system uses the vector math functions present in all of the\n\nmajor codebases, and is both easy to understand, and very easy to\n\nconfigure.\n\n\nVECTOR? THAT'S A CEREAL!!\n\n\nWhat follows is going to be a very brief, very informal, and quite\n\nlikely imprecise definition of what vector math is. The purpose of this\n\ntutorial is to teach you to code, not to teach you higher math. The vector\n\nfunctions are used in this system because they facilitate the result. The\n\nend justifies the means.\n\nIn science, specifically physics, there are two main kinds of\n\nphysical quantities: Scalars and Vectors. A scalar is a quantity that is\n\ncompletely specified by a number with appropriate units. 10 degrees\n\nFahrenheit. 4 inches. 100ml. Those are all scalar values. They completely\n\nspecify the measurement. No direction is required.\n\nVectors are not just a current state. They are the displacement of\n\na thing, defined as a change in position. A plane, flying at 500mph, is\n\ngoing in a direction. Because of its state, its position is changing from\n\none place to another. The cumulative description of both its speed and\n\ndirection is a vector.\n\nHow does this apply to time? Well, what we are going to do in our\n\nIC time system is establish a starting point, from which all IC time is\n\ncalculated"}

Mike Pence, a potential 2016 presidential contender, announced Tuesday that he had won federal approval for a form of Medicaid expansion that includes elements championed by conservatives.\n\nIndiana becomes the tenth state with a Republican governor to take up the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, though Pence won some concessions that could give him conservative bragging rights. For instance, people eligible for the Indiana program would have to contribute to a health savings account \u2014 and some will lose their coverage and get locked out for six months if they don't pay up.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nPence sought to find a way of enabling Indiana to accept billions of federal Affordable Care Act dollars to cover 350,000 uninsured adults, while also promoting some of his own ideas about free market approaches to health care, and personal responsibility.\n\nHis approach, known as Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0, is different from that of other potential 2016 contenders like GOP Govs. Chris Christie and John Kasich. They both enacted straight Obamacare Medicaid expansions in their states and didn't negotiate a compromise with the federal government on how to do it.\n\nAll of the Medicaid expansion plans cover people up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The federal government pays the full cost through 2016 and at least 90 percent after that. Including Indiana, 28 states and the District of Columbia have enacted the Obamacare option.\n\nPence \u2014 who insisted Tuesday that he still wants Obamacare to be repealed \u2014 has long tried to show that he can bring about conservative alternatives to Washington. He described the plan as a victory for Indiana's working poor and said it would empower them to provide for themselves. Health care advocates on a national level had urged CMS to reject several elements of the proposal, though Pence had the support of the state's hospital association and Indiana-based advocacy groups.\n\n\"We were always willing to compromise on the details of this plan,\" he said Tuesday. \"We were never willing to compromise the principles of personal responsibility.\" Medicaid expansion will kick in in Indiana on Feb. 1.\n\nConservatives cried foul when Pence first announced that he would seek to get an expansion model approved that they describe as less conservative than the original Healthy Indiana Plan, created by his predecessor Gov. Mitch Daniels.\n\nAs Pence pointed out on Tuesday, Daniels' program was approved with bipartisan support from the Indiana Statehouse. It included a longer lock-out period for people who didn't pay into their accounts, enrollment caps and premium payments as a condition of eligibility for people who had incomes below the poverty line. Those conditions were jettisoned during Pence's negotiations with federal officials over what was allowable under Obamacare expansion.\n\nIndiana submitted its Medicaid expansion proposal in July for federal approval, and silence over the course of several months led observers to believe that negotiations had stalled over details that were unpalatable to the Obama administration. But Pence ended up getting several conservative ideas approved.\n\nHe didn't get a work requirement, but Indiana will try to encourage employment through a state-funded incentive program. All enrollees will also pay copays if they make an unnecessary trip to the emergency room, and individuals with incomes below the poverty level must pay copays \u2014 consistent with current Medicaid rules \u2014 if they don't contribute to their health savings accounts.\n\nSen. Dan Coats, an Indiana Republican, on Tuesday lauded the state for being a national leader \"by creating state-based, innovative ideas for governing.\"\n\nPence said he thought the new plan could be a model for the country, and there are signs of interest from other states. In Wyoming, a legislative committee said they supported a proposal for Medicaid expansion modeled off the Indiana plan, instead of the model developed by Gov. Matt Mead. North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory has said he is looking at other states' waivers for inspiration.\n\nAnd the feds' approval of another red state's approach could move efforts in Tennessee and Utah, where governors are trying to gain support for expansion in their state legislatures.\n\nLike Tennessee's proposed plan, Pence said Indiana hospitals will help fund the program. Cigarette taxes will also finance the plan.\n\nIndiana Hospital Association President Doug Leonard said in a statement, \"By leveraging billions of dollars in available funding, we can strengthen the state's health care safety net, which is strained by the rapidly growing costs of uncompensated care. All Hoosiers will reap tremendous benefits from this decision.\"\n\nSarah Wheaton contributed to this report."}

If only some of his other, more ambitious ideas warranted the same praise. Take his latest plan, to shoot people off to Mars. Though details remain a bit confused, the key takeaway is tickets to Mars would sell for the modicum price of $200,000 apiece by 2024.\n\nOf course, Musk's plan assumes someone is willing to front $10 billion or more to pay for all that gee-whiz rocketry and infrastructure he described at the International Astronautical Congress. (It also assumes $10 billion is enough, but more on that later.) When SpaceX debuted, Musk claimed his rockets would be 10 times cheaper, 10 times more reliable, and provide 10 times the flight rate of existing rockets\u2014at least a 1,000-fold improvement that never came true. Musk's ambitions seem to rely on that old Silicon Valley magical thinking, of an exponential growth curve predicting cheaper access to space. But he offers neither sufficient technology improvements nor evidence of demand to add up to a $200,000 trip to Mars. Musk is coming from a Moore's Law world of computers and cars. Mars is not a Moore's Law world.\n\nWIRED OPINION About John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, is an expert in space, defense, and intelligence policy, and is frequently called upon to testify in front of congress on these issues.\n\nConcerning technology, two types of problems exist: engineering problems that can be solved and physics problems that cannot be solved, only accepted and worked around. Solutions to engineering problems generally have a key performance parameter that embodies the essence of the solution. Take Moore's Law. Around 1965, Intel co-founder Gordon Moore observed that overall processing power for computers\u2014the number of transistors on an equal-cost CPU\u2014would double every two years or so. Moore's Law was born, with a pretty amazing S-curve with persistent exponential growth that is responsible for the technological vastness of the future.\n\nA Moore's-like growth curve requires an infinitesimal number of intermediate steps of improvement. Each year's CPU, airplane, or automobile is slightly better than last year's. As economies of scale lower costs, the market expands.\n\nIn contrast to computers and cars, technologies with which Musk is familiar, rockets cannot be systematically improved. Specific impulse\u2014the number of pounds of thrust produced per pound of propellant\u2014is the key parameter capable of producing significant cost reductions in access to space. Technological solutions to improving specific impulse include building lighter rockets or finding better fuels. And rocket scientists optimized both of those when Eisenhower was president. That leaves the physics problem: Mass versus gravity. The only way to work around it is through economies of scale, driving down operational costs through an increased launch tempo.\n\nThe problem with economy of scale is it relies on demand. SpaceX's current launch tempo owes a lot to commercial satellite launches. Information is space's biggest market. Naively, one might have hoped that the growth in satellite communications would have increased demand, and thus launch tempo, driving down prices. But the capacity increase was, ironically, eaten up by Moore's Law\u2014which allows satellites to transmit more information. Communications satellites have not significantly increased the demand for mass to orbit.\n\nCrewed spaceflight, in order to incur demand without cost, must go from the Wright brothers to the Concorde with no intermediate steps. But putting people into the equation makes the continuous improvements harder to meet. There are a handful of \"islands of stability\"\u2014discrete objectives for piloted missions\u2014100 km hop for tourists, low Earth orbit, the Moon, and Mars. Similarly, there was an X-Prize for a 100-kilometer altitude flight, but none for 200 km. But the increments between those are huge, in terms of cost. No one remembers the first astronaut to go halfway to the Moon, because nobody cares what's between the two. There was nothing between Neil Armstrong's small step for a man and his giant leap for mankind. The very nature of space makes incremental steps moot.\n\nOne of the fundamental problems with a grand visionary projects such as shooting people to Mars is they do nothing to solve the underlying problem of physics, laws of thermodynamics, and the most grand, visionary aspect of all: How to pay for them. Musk ignores the fact that NASA and others have outlined similar roadmaps to Mars for more than 50 years. He waves away the risks and technical limits of current technology to make it happen reliably, cheaply and safely, as if Moore's law is easily applied. He shies away from discussing the infrastructure and work required to make it happen, letting others spell it out.\n\nMoore's Law is a product of Silicon Valley, as is the tendency to misapply\u2014with overreaching drama\u2014it to various capital-P Problems.

Japanese variations will sing to you. Harmony will also join you in the sack and she has a frigid setting for blokes who enjoy fantasies about women who resist.\n\nCompared with the murky world of sexual politics, inflated definitions of sexual harassment, overblown accounts of rapists waiting around every campus corner, the politics of sex robots are delightfully simple. Harmony has an on-off button, after all.\n\nIn recent weeks women have been busily debating the ethics of the sex robot, first on Slate's Double X podcast, then on Mamamia a few days after. Is it dehumanising women? (It's a doll. Does that mean porn is off bounds too, girls?) Isn't it just an efficient way of \u00adderiving sexual pleasure? (Yes.) Does it take rape fantasy over the line? (No, it's a doll. She's not real. There is no consent or lack of consent.) All heady stuff if you're caught up on how sex with a silicon doll is going to change men.\n\nRead Next\n\nHere's another way of looking at it: ask not how a silicon sex robot will change men but how real-life women are doing that \u00adalready with their vivisection of men, dissecting what's bad about them, depicting them as vessels of white, male privilege and likely sexual predators.\n\nReleased this week, the Australian Human Rights Commission's Changing the Course report into sexual assault and sexual harassment at Australian universities is a textbook case of the intersection between the foggy world of sexual politics and the crystal-clear aim of activists to propagate hysteria \u00addespite the facts. The data from the report simply does not support the existence of a rape culture on campus.\n\nThat's the case even with dodgy methodology aimed at boosting the numbers. Ninety per cent of people did not respond to the survey and the report admits the 10 per cent of self-selecting students who did respond were \u00ad\"motivated\" to do so.\n\nThe finding that 1.6 per cent of students were sexually assaulted was taken over a two-year period and included \u00adassault in \"university settings\" such as travelling to and from campus. Even the definition of sexual \u00adassault was expanded to inflate numbers, yet still the data doesn't support hyperbole that there is a rape epidemic on Australian campuses.\n\nWhen it comes to episodes of campus sexual harassment, the devil is in the detail. The report \u00addefines sexual harassment as \u00adstaring or leering, suggestive comments or jokes, or intrusive questions about someone's private life or physical appearance. That settles it then. We have surely all been perpetrators of sexual harassment.\n\nIn the deliciously confusing, often exhilarating yet frustrating flirtations between the sexes, scrutinising a sexual advance is no easy thing. Some stares, jokes, suggestive comments and questions as to whether you're single will be welcome sexual banter. In which case, enjoy the evening. Some will be misfired sexual advances, an \u00adinchoate flirtation that simply wasn't reciprocated. In which case, no harm done and adieu.\n\nHow else does a relationship, let alone a casual hook-up, start if not with a lingering look, a suggestive joke, a question about your private life. Human interactions don't happen in a sterile test-tube laboratory setting. They occur \u00adbetween people seeking sex, love, laughs, people full of flaws and emotions where mixed messages are not uncommon. And as sex therapist and author Esther Perel pointed out in a TED talk a few years ago: \"Most of us get turned on at night by the very same things we might demonstrate against during the day. The erotic mind is not very politically correct.\"\n\nIn short, sexual politics are far more complicated than the simplistic findings of the commission's report and its nine-point plan to stamp out wicked sexual practices on campus. For every claim of sexual harassment and sexual assault, there may be \u00adanother side to the story. If that other side is not sought out or even mentioned as a caveat to the \"data\", it exposes the report as propaganda rather than a search for truth.\n\nThe collection of the commission's data was inseparable from the politics of the rape-culture \u00adactivists. Nina Funnell, an advocate for rape victims, claimed that \"now we have the data to back up our \u00adassertions\". And this from \u00adSophie Johnston of the National Union of Students: \"It broke my heart to read this report \u2026 this is a cultural battle we are fighting everywhere.\"\n\nJohnston is right that there is a cultural battle under way across society but not in the way she has imagined. This report is more \u00adevidence that the gathering of knowledge has been bumped aside in favour of the accumulation of power. Here is postmodernism"}

According to the Independent, Read sent an email saying \"This is not a joke. I'm a registered nurse. I've been watching 'Flip or Flop.' I noticed that the host Tarek has a large nodule on his thyroid, and he needs to have it checked out.\"\n\nThe email prompted El Moussa to get a biopsy of the lump, which he was previously told was benign. That's when he found out that he had thyroid cancer, which had spread to his lymph nodes.\n\nBut thanks to the eagle-eyed Read, El Moussa was able to catch the illness before it spread farther. He had the nodule removed and after receiving treatment, he's now in remission.\n\nIn an interview with People, El Moussa says \"I feel good, but I don't have the energy I used to have.\"\n\nEl Moussa, his wife, and their two children are now happily readjusting to life without cancer. Their son, Brayden, was just born in August. But as El Moussa says, \"The last three years have been a pretty big challenge.\""}

A study published in Science on April 14 fills this gap. An international team of ecologists and environmental scientists found that bird and mammal populations were reduced within 7 and 40 km of hunters' access points, such as roads and settlements.\n\nWithin these impact zones, mammal populations declined on average by 83% and bird populations by 58%. Additionally, the team found that commercial hunting had a higher impact than hunting for family food, and that hunting pressure was higher in areas with better accessibility to major towns where wild meat could be traded. The impact of hunting was found to be larger than the team expected. 'Thanks to this study, we estimate that only 17 percent of the original mammal abundance and 42 percent of the birds remain in hunted areas.'\n\nThe researchers synthesised 176 studies to quantify hunting-induced declines of mammal and bird populations across the tropics of Central and South America, Africa and Asia. The study was led by Ana Ben\u00edtez-L\u00f3pez, who works at the department of Environmental Science at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. She cooperated with researchers from the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL), the universities of Wageningen and Utrecht in the Netherlands and a colleague from the School of Life Sciences, University of Sussex.\n\nHigher hunting pressure around villages and roads\n\n'There are several drivers of animal decline in tropical landscapes: habitat destruction, overhunting, fragmentation etcetera. While deforestation and habitat loss can be monitored using remote sensing, hunting can only be tracked on the ground. We wanted to find a systematic and consistent way to estimate the impact of hunting across the tropics. As a starting point, we used the hypothesis that humans gather resources in a circle around their village and in the proximity of roads. As such, hunting pressure is higher in the proximity of villages and other access points. From there the densities of species increase up to a distance where no effect of hunting is observed. We called this species depletion distances which we quantified in our analysis. This allowed us to map hunting-induced declines across the tropics for the first time,' Ben\u00edtez-L\u00f3pez explains.\n\nNot only the big cuddly species\n\nThe main novelty of the current study is that it combined the evidence across many local studies, thus for the first time providing an overarching picture of the magnitude of the impact across a large number of species. The study takes all animals into account -- not only the big cuddly species, but birds and rodents as well. Ben\u00edtez-L\u00f3pez explains the difference in impact between birds and mammals: 'Mammals are more sought after because they're bigger and provide more food. They are worth a longer trip. The bigger the mammal, the further a hunter would walk to catch it.' With increasing wild meat demand for rural and urban supply, hunters have harvested the larger species almost to extinction in the proximity of the villages and they must travel further distances to hunt. Besides, for commercially interesting species such as elephants and gorillas, hunting distances are much larger because the returns are higher.\n\nProtected areas are no safe haven\n\nAnother interesting finding of this study is that mammal populations have also been reduced by hunting even within protected areas. 'Strategies to sustainably manage wild meat hunting in both protected and unprotected tropical ecosystems are urgently needed to avoid further defaunation,' she says. 'This includes monitoring hunting activities by increasing anti-poaching patrols and controlling overexploitation via law enforcement'."}

Velociraptor had been discovered forty years earlier but was known only from a skull and a few bones of its hands and feet.[1]\n\nThe skeleton of Deinonychus were first to show the now infamous sickle-shaped retractable foot claw (8 inch), used for ripping open the skin of a victim, causing the preys guts be ripped and with a considerable amount of damage. Deinonychus also had a nasty bite, with over 60 knife-like teeth. Although with a deadly bite its arms and legs would be most powerful and could rear on one leg and kick an opponent.[1]\n\nDr. John Ostrom discovered Deinonychus in 1964. Dr. Ostrom believed that this dinosaur was an agile, swift predator, more like a warm-blooded mammal or bird than a cold-blooded crocodile.[1]\n\nWikipedia has a more detailed and comprehensive article on Deinonychus\n\n\nBehind the scenes\n\nDeinonychus was the basis for novel canon's Velociraptors and in turn the raptors seen in the films.\n\nJurassic Park novel author Michael Crichton visited John Ostrom\u2014the discoverer of Deinonychus\u2014when doing research for the novel. Ostrom said that Crichton's Velociraptor was based on Deinonychus in \"almost every detail\" and Crichton had even called him to inform him that he had renamed the Deinonychus in his novel to Velociraptor because he felt it sounded \"more dramatic\".[6]\n\nDuring the production of the Jurassic Park film, Steven Spielberg's production contacted John Ostrom and requested copies of all the technical papers that Ostrom had done of Deinonychus.[6] Unlike the novel, the raptors that were seen in the film were to be properly named Deinonychus and Mark \"Crash\" McCreery had even made concept art of this raptor in 1991,[7] but later in pre-production it was renamed to Velociraptor."}

On Nikolai's chest there's a medal \"for returning Crimea.\"\n\nSource: Russian social network Vkontakte\n\nThe 31st Independent Guards Airborne Assault Brigade went for exercises on August 3. From Ulyanovsk (the unit's location) they went on trucks to Chebarkul training grounds in Chelyabinsk. Nikolai Kozlov, who grew up in Ozersk near Chelyabinsk, looked around yet the familiar Ural mountains were nowhere to be seen. Steppes stretched along the road. Soon everyone understood: They were going to Ukraine.\n\n\"They probably sent him to Crimea the same way: They allegedly redeploy you for exercises, and bang, you are in Sevastopol. The tour of duty order has been signed, you can't refuse. The system works the way that the brass knows what to do and the soldiers have no voice,\" says Nikolai's uncle, Sergei Kozlov. \"I asked Nikolai, 'Did you sign any papers?' He said, 'If I had to, everything was signed for me.'\"\n\nAccording to Ozersk draft center, before June 2013, 21-year old Nikolai Kozlov, vehicle mechanic by profession, was doing compulsory military service in military unit 73612, the 31st Independent Guards Airborne Assault Brigade; since August 2013 he had been serving as a contract soldier in the same unit.\n\nNikolai's first military mission was in Crimea. According to photos the paratrooper's father posted to his Vkontakte page, at first Nikolai (as his father put it) \"protected the new government in the uniform of young, unidentified polite people [Russian units in the covert invasion of Crimea] and then in a Berkut [former Ukrainian riot police unit] uniform.\" Now Nikolai's photo in a Ukrainian police uniform has been circulating on the Internet. Many have suggested that Russian paratroopers dressed as Berkut participated in dispersing the Maidan protests in February. Sergei believes the photo was taken in a corridor of the Supreme Council of Crimea that Nikolai probably guarded under the guise of a Berkut member. \"The young are silly, they post photos everywhere: from Ukraine, from Crimea\u2026 no one saw any photos from Kyiv. Our guys probably weren't there. And then Nikolai is an anti-sabotage specialist, they weren't taught to wave batons.\"\n\nWith a medal \"for returning Crimea\" Nikolai returned to Ulyanovsk. He married. In August, he ended up in Ukraine.\n\nNikolai fought there for two weeks. According to the combat mission (as he explained to his cousin Dmitry), he suppressed the enemy artillery positions.\n\n\"Nikolai says Ukrainians are very clever and cunning fighters,\" Sergei told us. \"Their artillery is surprisingly accurate. Kolya's unit was lured into a trap. First the Ukrainians took two of them prisoner. On August 24, our guys went to take them back and were fired upon.\"\n\nAs Kozlov told his uncle, they were shot with some armor-piercing gun. The first shot tore Nikolai's leg off.\n\n\"Everyone thought him dead,\" Sergei Kozlov says. \"One of the soldiers managed to carry him away from the line of fire. Nikolai himself tourniqueted what was left of his leg to stop the bleeding and injected the medicines.\"\n\nThen for two days they drove Kolya, with sepsis, fever and a great loss of blood, back to the border. In the Rostov military hospital (full of wounded, according to Kolya) he was operated on and sent to Moscow.\n\nThe paratrooper first called home from the Central military clinical hospital named after Vishnevsky. The officers did not bother, so Kolya had to borrow someone's mobile phone. \"He only named the hospital, and it has loads of branches all over Moscow region. Thank God I live in Moscow. I started looking for him, enlisted my friends and barely managed to find him,\" Sergei says.\n\nAccording to doctors' predictions, Nikolai will stay in the hospital for more than four months. According to official figures from the military insurance company, soldiers who become Group 1 disabled get 1.5 million rubles. \"That's about 15 months of German unemployment benefits,\" Sergei counts. \"Not enough to become disabled in your youth.\" Sergei notes that as he spoke to his nephew he did not notice that the latter had any interest in the events in Ukraine or went to fight for his ideas.\n\n\"What politics, the guy's 20\u2026 An airborne assault brigade is the elite, the special forces,\" Sergei Kozlov says. \"It's cool there, you have a good chance to get to the UN peacekeeping force and see the world.

Not surprisingly, it was a poor substitute for genuine discourse. While it is hard to find much that people will agree about in this election cycle, there are a couple of truths that present themselves with little dispute. First, the role of social media in the personal, professional, and public lives of most American's has increased dramatically since the last election. Second, the major candidates running for office are diametrically opposed on almost every issue. On their own neither of these statements are particularly shocking nor revealing; however, taken together these two situations are undermining our ability to have a sane national conversation and they are silencing the conversation.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA and HYPERBOLE\n\nIn this election cycle it seems everything is controversial. The candidates, playing the part and aware of their low favorability ratings, maintain positions that go to extremes to distance from the other. Likewise, many supporters from all sides have decided to forgo public discourse, instead relying on memes, tweets, caricatures, cynicism, slander, and hyperbole in an attempt to vilify not only the individual candidates, but also their supporters. The extremism has created an environment wherein people strive to distance themselves from others, rather than bridge the gap. The resulting chasm leads to a situation referred to in political science as the spiral of silence, a situation where people have a tendency to not speak up about policy issues \u2014 publicly or privately \u2014 when they believe their point of view is not generally accepted.\n\nIn this spiral of silence, minority opinion holders fear social isolation. As these minority voices continue to feel distanced the fear builds and builds, spiraling into silence. Better, they think, to remain silent than risk social isolation by advocating a position that is widely panned. Introduce social media, where people measure their social worthiness \u2014 and sometimes more \u2014 by the amount of likes, shares, and forwards they receive and one can see how many people may decide to not express their opinions. The resulting self-censorship stifles conversation and makes the extreme voices even louder. Unfortunately, many of these people are not even minority opinion holders in the first place, the social media and political environment has just made them feel that way.\n\nTHE ROAD TO EXTREMISM\n\nThe prevalence of social media as a way to get \"headline\" news out quickly allows everyone to become an active participant in the news cycle. However, the character limit of Twitter, the pure volume of posts on Facebook, the rapid information dissemination offered by WhatsApp, Instagram, and like-minded services all makes it hard to stand out. To rise above the din, to prove a point, to be heard, one must make a point and make it quick. The most efficient way to achieve that is through hyperbole. From the innocent 'best day ever/worst day ever' posts to the vitriolic commentary that fills the comments sections of articles, extreme points of view tend to stand out. As such, many people express extreme views \u2014 views they may not even believe \u2014 merely to be heard. Conversely, many people who are unwilling, or unable, to go to the extremes end up falling silent because they choose to say nothing or they get lost in the noise. Politicians and the media are exploiting this environment.\n\nThe American public holds its leaders responsible for their social media output, but they do not impose the same responsibility on the individual. Additionally, the individual possesses an anonymity that the public figure cannot and does not want to retain. Shrewd politicians and the media exploit the strength of social media, allowing the people, unencumbered by anything other than personal ethics, to act as their surrogates. As surrogates, many Americans have willingly entered into the foreground of this election cycle, promoting their preferred candidate with fanaticism and making clear their disgust of the other candidate. Social media has become a hyperbolic battleground where political extremism increasingly dominates and understanding is in short order. This social media extremism is not without consequence; it has a pernicious influence on thought.\n\nSince social media is in the hands of the people it is much more personal and pervasive. In an attempt to align with one side or the other, many people modify their beliefs to fit a dominant narrative. Unfortunately, the dueling narratives are on the extremes and leave little room for the middle ground. Using the public as surrogates, the partisan media fans the flames in an attempt to garner ratings. And very few politicians have any interest in upsetting the bipartisan status quo since they benefit from its zero-sum nature.\n\nSILENCE: THE PRICE OF EXTREMISM\n\nThis extremism comes with a price, especially when emotional and morally laden issues are met with mockery and contempt. When everything is contradictory and nothing is generally accepted people are compelled to choose a side, a person must be either this or that, one or the other."}

Clark Kauffman/The Register\n\nBudget cuts force travel restrictions\n\n(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nBlaming deep budget cuts, the state agency that advocates for the elderly and people with disabilities in Iowa nursing homes has eliminated virtually all staff visits to those facilities.\n\nThe change at the office of the Iowa Long-Term Care Ombudsman comes at the same time the office has lost its top administrator, Deanna Clingan-Fischer.\n\nHer former office, which is run out of the Iowa Department on Aging, employs eight regional ombudsmen to advocate for residents of nursing homes and assisted-living centers, investigate complaints of abuse and neglect, and provide training for care-facility workers.\n\nThat job got tougher after the office's annual budget, which includes $1.3 million from the state and $400,000 from the federal government, was cut by roughly $500,000 in the fiscal year that began last month.\n\n\"It was quite a massive cut,\" Clingan-Fischer said. \"I made a decision to not lay off people, partly because we were severely understaffed as it was.\"\n\nDeanna Clingan-Fischer, Iowa long-term care ombudsman (Photo: Special to the Register)\n\nWith 82 percent of the Iowa ombudsman's budget consumed by salaries, Clingan-Fischer eliminated the agency's next largest expense: in-state travel, which costs $65,000 to $85,000 annually.\n\nAccording to data from the ombudsman's office, the staff there made more than 5,000 visits to Iowa care facilities in the 2015-16 fiscal year.\n\nThe budget cutbacks have prompted protests from advocates for seniors, including John Hale, an Ankeny consultant who specializes in issues affecting the elderly.\n\nIn a recent column for The Des Moines Register, Hale said the budget cuts must be reversed.\n\n\"The Iowans charged with protecting the health, safety and rights of residents in Iowa nursing homes can no longer go to these places in person to thoroughly investigate complaints and fully advocate for residents,\" Hale wrote. \"I refuse to accept that there is no money available to fund such essential services.\"\n\nDean Lerner, who under former Gov. Chet Culver headed the state agency that inspects nursing homes, said the budget cuts are not a surprise.\n\n\"This is just part of an overall scheme to reduce state oversight of these care facilities,\" he said. \"This is deliberate. It's intentional.\"\n\nLori Smetanka, executive director of the National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care in Washington, D.C., said residents' lives may depend on restoring the ombudsman's budget.\n\nWithout facility visits, it's difficult to build relationships with residents to get the information needed to thoroughly investigate complaints, she said.\n\nIowa is one of the few states to have a required response time for nursing home call buttons, but many Iowans will be surprised to learn how long staff are allowed to take. (Photo: Rufous52, Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\n\"A regular on-site presence allows them not only to respond quickly to complaints but also to identify some concerns early, before they become big or serious,\" Smetanka said.\n\nThe most recent data from the Administration for Community Living indicates that in 2015 only nine other states had a higher ratio of long-term care ombudsmen to nursing home residents.\n\nThe data also show that Iowa's ombudsman's office ranked last in the percentage of nursing homes visited at least once per quarter. In Iowa, 12 percent of nursing homes were visited quarterly, while the national average was 67 percent.\n\nClingan-Fischer recently resigned her post and accepted a new job as the ombudsman for Iowa State University.\n\nShe pointed out that whoever is appointed to take her old job could decide to restore some of the funding for travel and shift the spending cuts to other areas of the budget.\n\nBut Cindy Pederson, the interim long-term care ombudsman, says the office is currently relying on telephones and other technology to connect with Iowa's nursing home residents. She said it's impossible to say what might prompt the office to conduct an on-site visit using money from other areas of the budget.\n\nClingan-Fischer said one factor in her decision to leave the ombudsman's office was the uncertainty surrounding the funding for the agency's work.\n\n\"I just needed to find a position where I didn't have to worry about budget cuts year after year,\" she said.\n\nIn years past, the office's regional ombudsmen would conduct on-site visits to speak with residents, their family members and care facility workers.\n\nAlmost 700 visits"}

Anesthesia Detox methods use opioid antagonist medications to shorten the duration of acute withdrawal to a period of minutes instead of several days or weeks. Furthermore, while under anesthesia the patient is not subject to discomfort or relapse. When the patient awakens, detoxification is complete and yet there is no awareness of experiencing the severe withdrawal syndrome. Physical craving is blocked, and oral naltrexone can be initiated to reduce the risk of relapse. Rapid detoxification under anesthesia has assisted thousands of patients to achieve freedom from opioid addiction.\n\nRapid Detox started in the late 1970's when doctors began writing about their work with anesthesia detox protocols. Since its first report in the late 70's, detoxification under anesthesia has gained tremendous popularity. Prominent physicians in this exciting and promising field of pharmacology and addiction medicine include Dr. Kebler, Dr. Loimer, Dr. Resnick, and Dr. Legarda. Their remarkable and revolutionary work has allowed thousands of patients to complete detoxification from opiates in a safe, efficient and humane manner.\n\nHow does it Work?\n\nAnesthesia Detox uses an infusion of FDA-approved medications including sedatives and antagonists. These intravenous medications quickly induce withdrawal and remove the opioids from the receptors while the patient is under sedation. The process takes place in an ICU of a hospital and lasts approximately 30 to 90 minutes. Throughout the detox process, a board-certified anesthesiologist and his team monitor patients' vital signs to ensure stability and that the withdrawal is proceeding successfully.\n\nIs Detoxification under Anesthesia Safe?\n\nThe Waismann Method\u00ae has performed thousands of successful anesthesia detox for nearly two decades. When physicians provide anesthesia assisted opiate detox responsibly, the results are astounding. The positive results achieved with anesthesia assisted opioid detox are much higher than with the traditional methods of detoxification. This protocol significantly reduces the length of withdrawal symptoms, along with the severity of the symptoms. The sedation of the patient allows for most of the severe discomfort associated with an opioid withdrawal syndrome to be overcome while the patient is unconscious. This results in a higher success rate. An experienced anesthesiologist should perform the anesthesia detox in a full-service hospital. A hospital provides patients with additional medical specialists that can accurately assess and assist in each case.\n\nTreatment centers should tailor treatment protocols based on patients' unique history and conditions. One detox technique should never offer to everyone and anesthesia assisted detox is no exception to this rule. Additional detox options should be available based on each individual's needs. Medical resources must be abundant. There should be no pre-set time or urgency to discharge. Additionally, detox centers should treat patients in private rooms, allowing for undivided attention and individualized medical care. Following these basic rules maximizes rapid detox safety and ensures the comfort of the patient."}

School officials display religious iconography through hallways and classrooms, including a large portrait of Jesus Christ, and an electronic marquee in front of the school scrolls Bible verses as students enter the building.\n\nThe lawsuit asks the court to issue an order prohibiting the school district from continuing to promote religion or disparage Plaintiffs' faith and to require the district to reimburse the Lanes for the cost of transporting C.C. to another school."}

The company later confirmed it would indeed be FIFA 18--not, as some imagined after PS Vita's watered down FIFA Football, FIFA For Switch.\n\nHowever, after a brief play session at E3 2017, it appears the football game coming to Nintendo's hybrid console is not quite the fully-fledged title I was hoping for. We already discovered that the Switch version won't run on the same engine and doesn't include The Journey, FIFA's story mode, but the problems run deeper than those. Upon playing FIFA 18 on Switch for the first time, it becomes apparent that this is definitely not FIFA 18. This is not the same game I played a month ago on PS4.\n\nFrom the character models to the feel of the dribbling, almost everything feels quite far removed from FIFA 18 on PS4 and Xbox One. It's probably closest to FIFA 15 or 16's gameplay in its on-pitch action--a little quicker both to respond and to move--and given I wasn't a huge fan of FIFA 18 at preview stage, that's probably a good thing.\n\nOther than that, it feels fairly feature-rich and as competent a FIFA port as you could realistically expect on Switch. Until you detach the Joy-Cons to play in multiplayer, that is.\n\nFor many FIFA players, the primary--if not only--reason to buy FIFA on Switch ahead of the full PS4, Xbox One, or PC versions would be to have the ability to play on the move with friends. But playing with just one Joy-Con each makes it far too difficult to enjoyably do so. Fewer buttons than a standard controller (you lose out on two triggers, a d-pad, and a stick) means less flexibility on the pitch. On the standard control scheme, no adaptations are made to the original controls, so instead of, say, assigning a heavy touch to a double flick of the left stick in lieu of the the absent right, there simply appears to be no way of performing a heavy touch. This also applies to skill moves, accurate changes of player while defending, changing tactics on-the-fly, finesse shots, driven passes, and all types of chipped kicks.\n\nTaking away functionality depending on your controller setup is incredibly frustrating, so here's hoping EA can implement an elegant solution in time for launch on September 29, 2017.\n\nWhile FIFA 18 feels a little dated, then, it is still a lot of fun. However, if you plan to play on-the-go-multiplayer--the port's primary advantage over the PS4 and Xbox One editions--it might be best not to switch flanks from console."}

Rather than being the capital of Great Britain and the United Kingdom it was to become the global hub for international capital. Not only were the markets opened up to international banks, the international rich were invited into London, to take residence and buy up the housing from the indigenous Londoners. Thatcher wanted to hollow out London, and show the indigenous population out of the city, to make for the international rich.\n\nThis process has been maintained and encouraged since Thatcher's departure, and the process has taken on an increased intensity in the last ten years, without global economic crises and jitters causing more and more of the international rich to move their capital and residencies into London.\n\nThe consequence has been that London's working classes, who have traditionally been ensconced in the areas around central London, e.g. Elephant & Castle and Islington have been bought out, and priced out of the rental market. Those remaining have found all the old traditional forms of life disappear, as trendy cafes', boutiques and fashion stores, together with an array of convenience stores run by people from all around the world take their place.\n\nIt is with a sense of despair that many working class Londoners, left in places, like Islington, see the gradual disappearance of the pub, and the working class culture that fostered within it. Said one such resident, living in Islington:\n\nAll the pubs \u2013 the local pubs \u2013 have shut down and there are these gastropubs where it's like \u00a35 for a pint.

I suppose that's where you can see the people who moved here. When I was a kid there'd be no need. We all went to the cinema, no need for a theatre. It's \u00a330 for a ticket, I couldn't afford that. I'm probably not even qualified to work in the caf\u00e9.\n\nIn the northern parts of Somers Town, amongst the several pubs which act as their totems and meeting points, the indigenous working class can be found. A man leans out from his balcony in a string vest and smokes a fag. St George's flags hang from pub and flat windows; desperate signs of a community experiencing a social and psychological death. It has been said that the size of the English working class community in Somers Town has diminished over the last forty years. This process was facilitated by Margaret Thatcher's policy of allowing people who rented Council Houses to buy the property. In Somers Town many members of the English working class community bought their Council house, sold up and then shipped out. In effect the English working classes started to abandon their own kind.\n\nThe spaces left by those who sold-up and shipped out were filled, thanks to private landlords and state policies, with immigrants, students and middle class types. This has meant a dilution of the working class culture in the area. The new arrivals have their own way of doing things, their own interests and friends. For example students on short-term lets have no real interest in investing in local community relationships, and will be gone sooner than they have arrived. Muslims don't drink. They do Mosques not pubs. The social networks of the English working classes are thus diluted, and their sense of belonging and security diminished. Some hark back, nostalgically. One recalls, 'Somers Town was lost a long time ago. It had everything you would associate with a working class culture \u2013 a street market, greengrocers, fish shops \u2013 but these had disappeared by the 1980s.

With advances in 4D ultrasound technology, detailed assessment of fetal behavior [] is now possible. Furthermore, modeling of intrauterine conditions has indicated a substantially greater luminance within the uterus than previously thought []. Consequently, light conveying perceptual content could be projected through the uterine wall and perceived by the fetus, dependent on how light interfaces with maternal tissue. We do know that human infants at birth show a preference to engage with a top-heavy, face-like stimulus when contrasted with all other forms of stimuli []. However, the viability of performing such an experiment based on visual stimuli projected through the uterine wall with fetal participants is not currently known. We examined fetal head turns to visually presented upright and inverted face-like stimuli. Here we show that the fetus in the third trimester of pregnancy is more likely to engage with upright configural stimuli when contrasted to inverted visual stimuli, in a manner similar to results with newborn participants. The current study suggests that postnatal experience is not required for this preference. In addition, we describe a new method whereby it is possible to deliver specific visual stimuli to the fetus. This new technique provides an important new pathway for the assessment of prenatal visual perceptual capacities.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\n6 Johnson M.H.\n\nMorton J.

Based on a prior computational model of the fetal visual system during the third trimester [], we propose that the fetus will produce more head turning to the upright contrasted with the inverted stimuli, in a manner consistent with postnatal studies.\n\nBehavioral responses to stimuli were assessed in 39 fetuses by an ultrasonographer and an experimenter, utilizing 4D ultrasound. Once comfortable, a set of 2D scans were taken comprising the fetal head position, maternal tissue thickness, fetal biparietal diameter, occipitofrontal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, femur length, and fetal estimated weight. Fetal biometry measurements demonstrated normal fetal growth without fetal anomalies. All participants were then asked not to talk during the study and to remain as still as possible in order to optimize image quality. The initial 2D scan also informed the experimenter of the precise location of the fetal head prior to the presentation of the stimuli.\n\n6 Johnson M.H.\n\nMorton J.

Richardson seems to recognize that, telling reporters that he \"got my head right\" this offseason when asked about his maturity.\n\nWords are one thing, but actions will tell the tale. One way that Richardson has tried to show a better approach has come in his dealings with defensive line coach Pepper Johnson. Richardson has been more open to Johnson's coaching in their second season together.\n\n\"I'm a little more compliant this year,\" Richardson said, via Newsday. \"Last year, I was a little more hardheaded. I felt my way worked. I felt like I knew the system. We were trying new stuff, so I just was being hardheaded.

He was not reported as giving a reason for his decision, but quoted by website Pro Gorod Saransk as saying that he hoped the investigation into his alleged involvement in doping would be \"objective and without pre-judgement'' and that he wished his team greater success in the future.\n\nSince the start of last year, four Russian Olympic racewalking champions have received doping bans.\n\nThe Russian athletics federation said in a statement that it has withdrawn its walkers from competitions \"to avoid causing damage to the image of Russian athletics and Russian sport as a whole.\"\n\nThe team will not compete until the Russian anti-doping agency finishes its investigation into Chegin, which was announced Wednesday.\n\nThat is \"99 percent\" likely to mean no Russian walkers will compete at next month's world athletics championships in Beijing, the federation's acting president Vadim Zelichenok told Russia's R-Sport agency. The only chance for them to compete will be if the investigation concludes very swiftly, he added.\n\n\"At the moment, there is the suspicion that this discipline [of athletes] could bring us disgrace at the world championships,\" Zelichenok said.\n\nZelichenok welcomed the news of Chegin's retirement.\n\n\"I heard he was supposed to make this statement. It's probably the only decision he could make in this situation,'' he told R-Sport. Zelichenok added that Chegin's national training center \"needs to be cleaned up'' but would not be closed. Two directors of the center, not including Chegin, have also been forced out in the past year because of doping bans.\n\nRussia won two of the three walk events at the 2013 world athletics championships. One of those gold medalists, Elena Lashmanova, was banned for doping a year later but kept her world gold medal and the Olympic gold she won in 2012.\n\nIn January, three more Olympic-champion Russian walkers were banned, leading to the resignations of both the president of the Russian athletics federation and the head coach.\n\nThe federation said Thursday that its athletes have been instructed not to work with Chegin or they could face sanctions. It was not immediately clear what this would mean for Russia's national walking training center, which is named in Chegin's honor and where he is the head coach. The federation, which does not directly oversee the center, said it had requested he be suspended from his job there.\n\nEarlier in the day, Russia swept the podium in the women's 10,000-meter walk at the European junior championships.\n\nThe Russian anti-doping agency said Wednesday that Chegin is suspected of having doping substances and either providing or attempting to provide them to unnamed athletes.\n\nBoth the World Anti-Doping Agency and track and field's world governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations, are also investigating Russian athletics as a whole after a German TV documentary, broadcast in December, alleged doping was commonplace and organized by senior officials."}

A faulty ignition switch, which caused cars to abruptly shut off, shutting down all systems inlcuding power steering and air bag deployment, is known to have caused the deaths of 13 people. She did promise to investigate it, though. During the hearing, Congresswoman Diana DeGette held up one of the defective switches, and pointed out that it could have been fixed for 57 cents per car.\n\nDocumentary filmmaker Michael Moore vented his rage about GM's callousness immediately on his Facebook page. It is strong stuff, but many share his outrage over unnecessary deaths, and corporate malfeasance. Of course, it is hard to arrest the \"profit motive\" or \"runaway capitalism,\" which he cites as the real culprits, so maybe just hunt down the executives who knew full well they were putting people's lives in jeopardy.\n\nIn Moore's words:\n\nSPONSORED\n\nI am opposed to the death penalty, but to every rule there is usually an exception, and in this case I hope the criminals at General Motors will be arrested and made to pay for their pre-meditated decision to take human lives for a lousy ten bucks. The executives at GM knew for 13 years that their cars had a defective ignition switch that would, well, kill people. But they did a \"cost-benefit analysis\" and concluded that paying off the deceased's relatives was going to be cheaper than having to install a $10 part per car. They then covered up their findings and continued to let millions drive around with the defective part in their cars. There would be no recalls. There would only be parents and the decapitated body parts of their dead children. See the USA in your Chevrolet. In 2007 a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration official recommended a formal investigation but was overruled by others in Bush's \"business-friendly\" Transportation Department.\n\nOnly now, under the newly-configured GM -- owned, essentially, by you and me from 2009 through last year -- has the truth come out. And my guess is that it has to do with the fact that a mother now runs General Motors. A few months ago, Mary Barra, a former resident of Flint, the daughter of GM union autoworker, was named its CEO. And it looks like she isn't one of the good ol' boys. She stepped forward, announced the truth of what GM did, ordered one massive recall after another, and now is showing up to face Congress in a few hours.\n\nThe Washington Post, in an otherwise good article, blames the whole sad affair on the \"corporate culture\" at GM. What a user-friendly term! To even have to read the words \"culture\" and \"General Motors\" in the same sentence is enough to make anyone gag. No, the cause of this tragedy is an economic system that places profit above everything else, including -- and especially -- human life. GM has a legal and fiduciary responsibility to its shareholders to make the biggest profits that it can. And if their top people crunch the numbers and can show that they will save more money by NOT fixing or replacing the part, then that is what they are going to goddam well do. F*** you, f*** me, and f*** everybody they sent to their deaths. That pretty much sums up their \"culture\". They knew they wouldn't get caught, and if they did, no one would ever serve any time.\n\nI hope someone in the Obama administration will get out the handcuffs, the SWAT teams, or the U.S. army if need be, march into GM headquarters in downtown Detroit and haul away anyone who is there who had anything to do with this. And if they already left town, hunt them down and bring them in to face justice."}

Those who report on national security, foreign affairs or the federal government are particularly likely to believe the government has already collected data about their electronic communications (71% say this is the case), according to a new survey of members of Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) \u2013 a nonprofit member organization for journalists \u2013 by the Pew Research Center in association with Columbia University's Tow Center for Digital Journalism.\n\nThus far, concerns about surveillance and hacking have mostly fallen short of keeping many journalists from pursuing a story or a source; Just 14% say that in the past 12 months, such concerns have kept them from pursuing a story or reaching out to a particular source, or have led them to consider leaving investigative journalism altogether.\n\nStill, these concerns have led many of these journalists to alter their behavior in the past 12 months. Nearly half (49%) say they have at least somewhat changed the way they store or share sensitive documents, and 29% say the same of the way they communicate with other reporters, editors or producers.\n\nAnd among the 454 respondents who identify as reporters, 38% say that in the past year they have at least somewhat changed the way they communicate with sources.\n\nWhen it comes to external protection from digital threats like surveillance and hacking, these investigative journalists do not put much stock in their internet service providers (referred to as ISPs). Just 2% have \"a lot of confidence\" their ISP can protect their data from being accessed by unauthorized parties, while 71% have not much or no confidence at all.\n\nNews organizations get mixed reviews for their ability to protect the security of their employees' communications. Among those who work for news organizations (589 of the 671 journalists surveyed), half say their employer is not doing enough to protect journalists and their sources from surveillance and hacking, while about the same share (47%) says they are doing enough. Just 21% say their organization has taken steps or implemented policies in the past year to protect journalists and their sources, while 36% say their organization has not, and 42% do not know. About half (54%) report getting no formal training or instruction on electronic security issues from professional sources such as journalism associations, news organizations or journalism schools.\n\nStill, other issues are more pressing for the profession than surveillance and hacking. When asked to rank four challenges facing journalists today, an overwhelming majority (88%) of journalists identify decreasing resources in newsrooms as their top concern. No other issue comes close. Following far behind are: legal action against journalists (5%), electronic surveillance by governments or corporations (4%) and hacking targeted at journalists or news organizations (1%). Furthermore, relatively few journalists (27%) have spent at least \"some time\" in the past 12 months researching how to improve their electronic security.\n\nOverall, these data paint a complex picture in which investigative journalists on the whole feel vulnerable to surveillance and hacking, but not to the degree that most are changing their journalistic practices dramatically or investing energy into figuring out how to do so. And nearly all of those surveyed (97%) say that for today's journalists, the benefits of digital communication like email and cellphones outweigh the risks. Just 3% say the risks outweigh the benefits.\n\nAbout This Survey\n\nThe analysis in this report is based on an online survey conducted from December 3-28, 2014, with a representative sample of 671 journalists who are members of Investigative Reporters and Editors, Inc. (IRE). The 671 investigative journalists include a mix of reporters, producers, editors, data specialists, photojournalists and others, and comprise a wide range of coverage areas.\n\nThe survey was written and analyzed by Pew Research Center staff, and field work was conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates International (PSRAI). Email invitations containing individualized survey links to access the online study were sent to 2,723 investigative journalists in the United States who are members of IRE. Journalists also had the option of returning a print version of the survey through the mail. For more detailed information, see the Methodology section."}

Since speed varies from computer to computer, you're going to have to regulate frame rate to keep the game from running too fast. If a game runs too fast it becomes unplayable. To prevent that you must cap the frame rate.This tutorial teaches you just that. Capping Frame Rate tutorial with SDL 2 is now available.\n\n//The frames per second const int FRAMES_PER_SECOND = 20;\n\nWe define our frames per second as a global constant.\n\n//Keep track of the current frame int frame = 0; //Whether or not to cap the frame rate bool cap = true; //The frame rate regulator Timer fps;\n\nHere are some variables declared in the main() function. The \"frame\" variable keeps track of how many frames have been animated, which is important for knowing where to blit the message surface in this demo program. There's also the \"cap\" variable which keeps track of whether the user wants to cap the frame rate.\n\n\nThen we declare a timer object which we use to cap the frame rate.\n\n//Generate the message surfaces message = TTF_RenderText_Solid( font, \"Testing Frame Rate\", textColor );\n\nNow we render the message surface that will move across the screen.\n\n//While the user hasn't quit while( quit == false ) { //Start the frame timer fps.start();\n\nNow we enter our main loop. At the beginning of every frame, we have to start our frame timer.\n\n//While there's events to handle while( SDL_PollEvent( &event ) ) { //If a key was pressed if( event.type == SDL_KEYDOWN ) { //If enter was pressed if( event.key.keysym.sym == SDLK_RETURN ) { //Switch cap cap = ( !cap ); } } //If the user has Xed out the window else if( event.type == SDL_QUIT ) { //Quit the program quit = true; } }\n\nHere we do our event handling. Basically this turns the FPS cap on/off when the user presses enter, and quits the program when the user wants to X out.\n\n\nYou typically don't need a variable to turn the frame regulation on/off when you're capping the frame rate in an actual game, but it's here in this program so you can see the difference between regulated and unregulated frame rate.\n\n//Apply the background apply_surface( 0, 0, background, screen ); //Apply the message apply_surface( ( SCREEN_WIDTH - message->w ) / 2, ( ( SCREEN_HEIGHT + message->h * 2 ) / FRAMES_PER_SECOND ) * ( frame % FRAMES_PER_SECOND ) - message->h, message, screen );\n\nThen we apply the background and message surface.\n\n\nDon't worry about all that coding that went into blitting the message surface. It was basically a shorter way of doing:\n\n\nif( frame % FRAMES_PER_SECOND == 0 )\n\n{\n\n//blit here\n\n}\n\nif( frame % FRAMES_PER_SECOND == 1 )\n\n{\n\n//blit there\n\n}\n\n\netc, etc.\n\n//Update the screen if( SDL_Flip( screen ) == -1 ) { return 1; } //Increment the frame counter frame++;\n\nThen we update the screen and increment the frame counter.\n\nNow we've finished everything we needed to do for this frame.\n\n//If we want to cap the frame rate if( ( cap == true ) && ( fps.get_ticks() < 1000 / FRAMES_PER_SECOND ) ) { //Sleep the remaining frame time SDL_Delay( ( 1000 / FRAMES_PER_SECOND ) - fps.get_ticks() ); }\n\nThis is where we do the actual frame rate capping.\n\n\nWhen we started the frame, we started a timer to keep track of how much time it took to output this frame. In order for this program not to run too fast, each frame must take a certain amount of time. Since 20 frames are being shown per second, each frame must take no less than 1/20th of a second.

(Historical Studies of Urban America.) Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2016. Pp. xviii, 390. $40.00. Raymond Wolters Am Hist Rev (2017) 122 (1): 210-211. Published: 31 January 2017 These days most books on social policy are \"argument\" books. Making the Unequal Metropolis: School Desegregation and Its Limits is a case in point. Ansley T. Erickson deserves high praise for the depth of her research. But this reviewer demurs when it comes to her argument. Erickson's book deals with school desegregation in Nashville, Tennessee. However, there are only passing references to the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka decisions of 1954 and 1955 or to numerous Supreme Court holdings during the next decade, all of which were based on the principle that the Constitution forbade racial discrimination by the government but did not require integration. This consensus was summed up in the Civil Rights Act of 1964: \"'Desegregation' means the assignment of students to public schools and within such schools without regard to their race, color, religion, or national origin, but 'desegregation' shall not mean the assignment of students to public schools in order to overcome racial imbalance\" (Title IV, Section 401b.). Erickson takes exception to this definition and instead makes a case for what she calls \"statistical desegregation\"\u2014that is, assigning students by race to create enrollments that correspond with the overall population ratios of large metropolitan areas. This sort of desegregation was achieved (for a while) after the Supreme Court, in a series of cases between 1968 and 1973, redefined the meaning of desegregation and required that students be assigned by race to achieve racially balanced school enrollments. Erickson favors this policy but acknowledges that court-ordered busing for racial balance did not efface substantial disparities in the average academic achievement of blacks and whites. By 1971, Nashville-Davidson County had complied with the mandate of Brown. Students were no longer assigned on the basis of race. Instead, they were assigned, regardless of race, to the nearest neighborhood schools. This, however, led to a situation where different schools had different proportions of black and white students. According to Erickson, this imbalance was not entirely the result of geography, individual choices, or economic wherewithal. It was also influenced by state and local government policies with respect to highways, housing, and low-interest loans. By constructing highways, the state facilitated the flight of whites to the suburbs. Government-regulated banks also fostered racial separation by giving low-interest loans only to people who were deemed creditworthy. And local governments situated most of their public housing in predominantly black areas. Erickson mentions that residents in the projects initially found themselves in improved circumstances. Nevertheless, she maintains that government policies contributed to a racially imbalanced pattern of settlement, and she argues that court-ordered busing was justified as a remedy for policies that affected blacks and whites differently. Essentially, Erickson makes a case for what constitutional lawyers once called \"the Keyes presumption,\" a presumption that the Supreme Court established in a 1973 case that involved Denver, Colorado. This presumption held that if a government policy limited racial interaction to even a slight extent, then any racial imbalance that existed elsewhere in a jurisdiction was not adventitious. At the time, Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. expressed profound misgivings over this idea, and eventually (in the 1990s and in 2007) the Supreme Court rejected the Keyes presumption. In the meantime, however, schools in metropolitan Nashville (and many other places) were required to have racially balanced enrollments. A court order of 1971 required each Nashville school to have an enrollment that was 15 to 35 percent black and 65 to 85 percent white. After this policy touched off white flight, additional court orders in 1980 and 1983 extended the desegregation area to all of Davidson County. As a result, Nashville achieved a degree of statistical desegregation that was unmatched by most American school districts. Nevertheless, Erickson writes, \"Nashville gave up on desegregation\" when the Supreme Court's decisions of the 1990s allowed a return to neighborhood schools (293\u2013294). \"After decades of out-desegregating most American school systems, Nashville moved much closer to the segregated mean\" (295). Nashville-Davidson County returned to racially imbalanced neighborhood schools for elementary students, and to large, comprehensive high schools where there were racially disproportionate enrollments in both advanced academic studies and vocational education. Erickson laments this turn away from court-ordered, racially balanced integration. She notes that the test scores of black students improved during the 1970s"}

Last week, the retailer reported a surprise third-straight quarter of U.S. same-stores declines.\n\n\"Black Friday is our Super Bowl, and we plan to win,\" said Duncan Mac Naughton, chief merchandising and marketing officer for Wal-Mart U.S., on Tuesday. He repeated the \"why\" part as well: six fewer shopping days from Thanksgiving to Christmas this year.\n\nStarting Tuesday, Wal-Mart will also extend its Christmas Ad Match to online customers. Shoppers who buy an item online and find a lower in-store competitor price can recoup the difference via a Wal-Mart gift card by emailing christmasadmatch@walmart.com. That policy has been in place for in-store shoppers, and it runs up to Dec. 24, excluding Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday.\n\nAmong the latest Wal-Mart offers: a LeapPad 2 for $39.99, dropped from $79, a Monopoly Board Game for $5 (from $7.77) and PS4 and Xbox video games, such as \"Call of Duty Ghosts\" and \"Battlefield 4\", down to $49 from $59.96.\n\nThere's no sign yet of how the other retailers plan to respond. But no doubt, if Wal-Mart is offering big sales this Friday, watch this space, as competitors' marketing teams scramble. Some analysts say none of this will save the holiday season, as fewer shoppers are expected to hit the stores and the Internet. Industry researchers such as Shopper Trek predict just a 2.4% rise in holiday sales this year.\n\nWal-Mart has been the subject of other news headlines this week.

Now, insurers can make the type of write off much clearer.\n\nThe old system of A, B, C & D categories are now replaced by the following new classifications:\n\nA \u2013 Scrap only\n\nB \u2013 Break for parts\n\nS \u2013 Structurally damaged but repairable\n\nN \u2013 Not structurally damaged, repairable\n\nA Category insurance write-offs\n\nA \u2013 Scrap only. This is a write-off in all senses of the term. An 'A' classification means the vehicle is too dangerous to be put back on the road and must be destroyed, by crushing.\n\nB Category insurance write-offs\n\nB \u2013 Break for parts. The 'B' classification applies to vehicles that again are too dangerous to be put back on the road, but salvageable parts can be removed (and sold) before the vehicle is destroyed.\n\nS Category insurance write-offs\n\nS \u2013 Structurally damaged but repairable. This new category indicates the vehicle has suffered significant enough damaged that it is no longer economically repairable by the insurance company's own repairer.\n\nN Category insurance write-offs\n\nN \u2013 Not structurally damaged, repairable. The other new category is fairly self-explanatory. Typical causes for this kind of 'write-off' would be cosmetic damage to sports bike panels or damage to steering locks and discs brakes during theft attempts. Like Category S, these vehicles are perfectly fine if repaired properly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nThe new classifications have been developed after a two-year consultation with Thatcham Research technical experts.\n\nAs the classifications are applied by insurers, and the code is voluntary, there is no guarantee the bike you may be buying has not been involved in an accident.\n\nIt's not unknown for owners to not declare an accident to an insurer and to put the motorbike back on the road. To avoid buying a 'bodged' bike, always get an inspection by a qualified mechanic if you don't have the technical and mechanical knowledge yourself.\n\nGet yourself sorted:\n\nIt's possible to get a bargain when you delve into the world of insurance write-offs.

Doctors said they would like to respect Lee's wishes and remove the tubes.\n\n\"She is desperate both because of her physical pain and the days that she's being made to endure in the hospital to simply have it end,\" Smith said.\n\nHer parents, the Rev. Manho Lee and Jin-ah Lee, have gone to court to keep her on life support, saying that removing the tubes would be suicide and would keep Lee from going to heaven.\n\n\"When someone sets a time and date to die, that is considered as a suicide and sin,\" Rev. Lee said through a translator.\n\n\"The family believes they know what's best. They know what's best for their daughter and they know best what their daughter thinks,\" the parents' attorney, Jeff Forchelli, told CBS 2's Carolyn Gusoff.\n\nFamily and friends claim that Lee isn't ready to give up.\n\n\"She wants to go home,\" Kim said.\n\nLee's family has been asking for prayers and posting updates on their legal bid on a Facebook page called \"Save Grace Sung Eun Lee.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the family posted a video of Lee agreeing that she would like to sign over her medical proxy to her father and that she would like to leave the hospital and be moved to a nursing home.\n\n\"We did it!!! God has heard our prayer!!! The hope is growing in her,\" the family wrote.\n\nWhen a man in the video asks Lee, \"When do you want to leave to the nursing home?\" she replies \"Now.\"\n\nBut Lee's lawyer said she has already made her decision known.\n\n\"The law is very clear, as it should be, that it's you and I who get to decide for ourselves what we want and not our parents,\" Smith told Gusoff.\n\nA spokesman for North Shore University Hospital said with all end of life decisions, it abides by the patient's wishes and follows the law.\n\nBoth sides are awaiting a decision from a panel of judges at the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court.\n\nShare your thoughts on this story below\u2026\n\n(TM and Copyright 2012 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

Rand Paul of Kentucky and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Paul would narrowly carry the Bluegrass State, according to a new poll.\n\nThe Bluegrass Poll, sponsored jointly by the Lexington Herald-Leader, the Courier-Journal, WKYT-TV and WHAS-TV, found that Paul would beat Clinton in Kentucky 48 percent to 44 percent.\n\nSurveyUSA conducted the poll of 1,782 registered voters from May 14 to 16.

But Paul enjoys 10-point leads over Clinton in the western (50 percent to 40 percent) and eastern (52 percent to 42 percent) ends of the state.\n\nThe two potential candidates tie with 46 percent apiece in north-central Kentucky, an area that includes Lexington and much of Northern Kentucky.\n\n\"You cannot read too much into poll results about a contest that is not happening and that is still so purely hypothetical that voters have not actually made informed decisions yet,\" Voss cautioned. \"But the strong numbers for Clinton, even against a favorite son of the state, looks like a good sign for her in general. After years in the Obama administration, she has not shed the popularity in Kentucky that allowed her to perform so strongly in our Democratic primary.\"\n\n(Clinton trounced Barack Obama by 35 percentage points and 250,000 votes in Kentucky's Democratic primary for president in 2008.)\n\nPaul enjoys the support of 81 percent of Republican respondents to Clinton's 13 percent, while Clinton has the support of 75 percent of Democrats to Paul's 19 percent. Among independents, Paul leads Clinton 44 percent to 40 percent.\n\nBroken down by ideology, Clinton wins 59 percent of self-described \"moderates\" to 33 percent for Paul. Among respondents who described themselves as conservative, Paul bests Clinton 79 percent to 15 percent, but among liberals, Clinton enjoys 88 percent of support to Paul's 6 percent.\n\nWhile Paul has made outreach to minority groups one of his top priorities, the poll found that only 29 percent of black respondents would back Paul compared with 62 percent who would vote for Clinton.\n\nRespondent Regina Lees of Elizabethtown said it's way past time to have a female president.\n\n\"I simply would vote for Hillary Clinton for president over Rand Paul because she's a woman. Women are a lot smarter than men,\" she said.\n\nBut James Mercer, who works in construction in Bowling Green, said he could never support Clinton.\n\n\"She let the world slide as secretary of state with the mess in Benghazi and she would perpetuate Obamacare,\" he said. \"I'm not particularly in love with Rand Paul, but I could never go for Hillary.\"\n\nAsked whether he ever could vote for a woman to be president, he responded: \"I could support a woman like (former Secretary of State) Condoleezza Rice, but she's too smart to run.\""}

However, like Garlic Jr. and Vinegar, he is completely healed of his fatal injuries and his power increases greatly when the Makyo Star is in Earth's orbit. As a result, he ultimately becomes much larger and more muscular, as well as more vicious and bloodthirsty. He again fights Gohan for a while as Vinegar simultaneously battles Krillin. He and Gohan seem evenly matched, even when he has progressed to his muscular form. Later, when Gohan is caught in the middle of Spice and Vinegar, he witnesses an injured Krillin falling, resulting in his anger exploding, and unleashing his latent power. He executes Spice and Vinegar at the same time with a powerful Double Masenko.\n\nPower\n\nAnime\n\nSpice is a formidable warrior in his own right. Being the strongest of the Spice Boys, he possesses frightening speed and ruthlessness, his speed even shocks Gohan. Spice was able to able to give Gohan some trouble in their initial fight.

The Complete, Uncut Original! 40 Minutes of Unseen Footage!\n\nGODZILLA\n\nRialto Pictures Presents the Landmark Monster Movie in Its Original Japanese Version, Never Before Released in the U.S.\n\nUncut, uncensored, and undubbed, the original \"Monster of Mass Destruction\" returns to the big screen like you've never seen him before, fully restored with 40 minutes of unseen footage and completely revised subtitles. See where it all began, with this influential classic that has spawned scores of sequels and imitations, but has never been bettered.\n\nOn a sunny day and calm waters, a Japanese steamer sinks in flames when the sea erupts; a salvage vessel sent to the rescue disappears the same way; exhausted, incoherent survivors babble of a monster. Could it be\u2026? GODZILLA was one the biggest budgeted films in Japanese history at that time, costing more than twice as much as the average Japanese movie. An enormous hit, it spawned 50 years of sequels, countless rip-offs, and a new genre: the kaiju eiga, or Japanese monster movie. Sold to an American distributor a year later, it was re-cut, re-arranged, dubbed, and re-titled GODZILLA KING OF THE MONSTERS with added scenes (shot in Hollywood) of a pre-PERRY MASON Raymond Burr observing the action from the sidelines.\n\nThe original Japanese GODZILLA is one of the great films by a sci-fi master, Ishiro Honda (Akira Kurosawa's close friend and occasional second unit director). The U.S. cut ran 20 minutes shorter, with another 20 snipped to make room for Burr, so that nearly a third (about 40 minutes) was shorn. The unrelentingly grim American version excised all of the film's comic relief (including some astonishing, Strangelove-like black humor) and censored its strong anti-H-Bomb message, turning it into a run-of-the-mill, monster-on-the-loose picture.\n\nIn Japan, the original, un-bastardized GODZILLA is regarded as one of the great classics of the cinema. In 1984, the prestigious film journal Kinema Junpo rated it among the top 20 Japanese films of all time. In 1989, a survey of 370 Japanese movie critics, Nihon Eiga Besuto 150 (Best 150 Japanese Films), ranked Godzilla the 27th greatest Japanese feature ever made.\n\nThe real (human) star of the movie is Takashi Shimura (best known for his Kurosawa roles, including the leader of THE SEVEN SAMURAI and the doomed man of IKIRU), as a revered paleontologist who insists that Godzilla must be studied, not destroyed (he's in the minority).

{"id": 259341, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "I've always had a soft spot for Heimerdinger. He was the second champion I played (behind a very confusing game as Twitch), and the first champion I considered my \"main\". Call it a soft-spot for small, intelligent characters, but something about the little afro-headed genius clicked. Turrets that farmed for me? Instantly-hitting rockets? You had me at substandard intelligence!\n\nOf course, as I continued my time in the League of Legends, the general stigma that followed my Heimerdinger obsession was made readily apparent; people, to this day, hate having the smartest Yordle ever on their team. His pick-rate is the fourth worst currently, and his win-rate fluctuates from average to 'meh'. Anyone playing him is instantly a \"troll\" or a \"noob\", and after a couple months of playing him, I was forced into different roles and champions.\n\nBut why is Heimerdinger so despised, left amongst the Lost Legends never to be seen again? He's had a rough balance history, and hasn't been touched recently, but does that mean he's as bad as his reputation? And with the sweeping changes of the ever-approaching Season Three, will he ever be considered pick-worthy?\n\nThere is potential in Heimerdinger; I noticed that in Season 2. The one match I had as Heimerdinger had more damage than my other, multiple-game AP mids. His turrets produce some of the most steady AP damage outside of Teemo, and his rockets have 285 base damage at max level. His grenade is potent as well, but landing it is tricky. Overall, the main problem with Heimerdinger is not that his damage is low, but merely inconsistent.\n\nGetting Heimerdinger's abilities to work in your favor is tedious, especially during the laning phase. His turrets generally shoot at anything that seems least threatening, his grenade moves slower than electricity seemingly should, and timing his rockets to hit just before that third minion is able to block them can drive any Summoner to madness. Without any priority to his spell targets beyond distance and luck, Heimerdinger's damage requires a surprising amount of patience and skill for a champion who seems so simple. A lot of this is removed in team fights; as long as their aren't enemy minions/pets to worry about, the damage from his rockets alone is brutal.\n\nRecently, I ran a sample blind-pick game to get some baring on whether the recent changes have made him any more viable. While I haven't had much luck picking him again (people tend to dodge games when they see Heimer), I will explain my thought process and build below.\n\nRole: AP Carry, Mid Lane\n\nRunes:\n\n\nWith my runes, I focus on getting as much penetration as possible, with mana regen and move speed for lane sustain and survival. The penetration Quintessence is optional, as an extra move speed rune in its place is just as helpful.\n\nMasteries:\n\n\nFairly standard masteries. Defense or Utility really depends on play style, but I can see both working.\n\nSummoner Spells:\n\nFlash, Ignite, Teleport\n\nFlash is essential, as it provides you with an easy escape (which Heimer is lacking). Secondary choice is more personal. Ignite is always nice, but Heimerdinger is usually not putting himself in range to use it. Teleport is the best alternative, but any can be used to match your play style.\n\nBuild Order:\n\nDorans Ring -> Haunting Guise -> Sorcerer's Shoes -> Void Staff -> Rabadon's Deathcap\n\nOptions:\n\nLiandry's Torment, Rylai's Crystal Scepter, Athene's Unholy Grail, Zhonya's Hourglass\n\nWith my items, I focus on getting as much magic penetration as possible, as quickly as possible. Heimerdinger's spells have high base damage with average ratios. I don't recommend instantly upgrading Haunting Guise, as it has the same penetration as Liandry's and the money is best spent elsewhere. After Void Staff, you've hit max penetration, and can start building damage. Rabadon's is essential, but after that the choice is more based on how team fights are going. Rylai's gets fully proc'd with each rocket, Zhonya's is great if you keep getting focused down in fights, and Athene's is a good solution for any mana problems.\n\nLaning:\n\nHeimerdinger is a defensive laner, and relies mostly on the poke from his rockets to keep his lane opponent at bay. Leveling skills generally goes in this order:\n\nRockets, Turrets, Grenade.\n\nRockets offer the best controllable damage, so I tend to level them first.\n\n"}

According to researchers from MIT, pretty good\u2014that is, if we look towards today's technological breakthroughs to ensure it.\n\nThe team has come to a positive, yet unexpected possibility\u2014that urban agriculture might be on the verge of an Internet-enabled revolution. Meaning, given that technology has now enabled new farming techniques and opportunities that allow for indoor, warehouse-based settings, food production can potentially accommodate high-density urban demands and maintain food security despite our unstable environment and exposure to vulnerabilities.\n\nAnd right now, a team of MIT technologists are working on creating a networked agricultural system anchored on the open-source software movement for inspiration.\n\n\"The current state of [networked agriculture] is very one-off,\" says Caleb Harper, principal research scientist for the Open Agriculture (OpenAG) Initiative at MIT's Media Lab. \"Everybody designs their own little unique 'data center' for plants, for a warehouse farm or for a vertical farm. They say it's super special, and they try to create intellectual property out of it. And they won't let people go in it, because they don't want other people to steal their brilliant ideas. That's the problem in my industry now. They haven't realized that there's a system that underlies this. And it won't scale until there is a common platform.\"\n\nThe Food Computer\n\nThis new platform that Harper is developing is a digitized food-growing system he dubs the \"Food Computer\" and it creates a controlled environment ideal for farming using robotic controls and actuated climate energy as well as plant sensing mechanisms.\n\nIt's designed to optimize agricultural production basically by creating the ideal climate inside a controlled chamber.\n\nTo do that, the Food Computer monitor will monitor and fine-tune elements such as light exposure, humidity, temperature, C02 level, water cycles, and nutrient delivery following a preset recipe.\n\nThe key here is that recipes for different crops, including the software that controls and monitors the data will be circulated freely among Food Computer users, allowing them to collaborate to tweak and improve the process depending on their current environment\u2014whether they're in the tropics or the Antarctic.\n\nThere are less than 10 Food Computers being used worldwide, but these are expected to grow. The growth of computerized vertical farming continues to boom and experts believe that the numbers will only get bigger in the coming years, thanks to the increasingly efficient technology of LED grow lights available today."}

Her lawyers argue the traveler misunderstood a question in court and gave a response that appeared to be a confession.\n\nWhile tramadol is legal in many countries as a prescription painkiller, it is illegal for a private individual to sell it in Egypt, where it is popular among lower-income sectors.\n\nPlummer said she had brought the drug to her Egyptian husband, Omar Abdel-Azim, who suffers from back pain.\n\nThe pair met five years ago in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, when Abdel-Azim worked as a lifeguard.\n\nThey were married in 2014 through an unregistered contract, known in Egypt as an \"urfi\" marriage. Plummer has been visiting her husband regularly since.\n\nA look at the court case\n\nIn court, Plummer's lawyers argued the drug was not listed as illegal in the UK travel advisory.\n\nThe UK's decision to add a warning against carrying tramadol while traveling to Egypt was issued in November -- a month after the arrest.\n\n\"For someone to be found guilty of drug smuggling they have to be aware that they are possessing narcotics,\" Plummer's lawyer, Mohamed Othman, told Reuters.\n\n\"Laura did not know that what she was carrying was a narcotic. This is pursuant to that tramadol 50mg is a painkiller in her country, England. When she brought the tramadol, she believed it was a painkiller.\"\n\nOthman told CNN that the sentence was light, considering the charges.\n\nIn a statement, the British Foreign Office said it \"will continue to provide assistance to Laura and her family following the court ruling in Egypt, and our embassy is in regular contact with the Egyptian authorities.\"\n\nAn appeal is planned\n\nPlummer's trial started in the town of Safaga on Monday with what her lawyers described as a mistaken confession.\n\nTheir client was asked whether she was intending to sell the drug. But she thought she was asked whether she simply possessed it, and said yes, the lawyers said.\n\nThe defense also rejected allegations of smuggling and trading charges. \"She had only 320 pills. Even the plane ticket is almost double the price of those pills,\" Othman said. \"It is illogical that she will deal in tramadol.\"\n\nDrug smuggling convictions sometimes carry the death penalty; others carry a minimum of 10 years in prison. It wasn't immediately clear whether Plummer was convicted for possession, smuggling or both.\n\nPlummer plans to appeal the sentence.\n\n\"It will take a while and she has to go back to the prison,\" said Plummer's mother, Roberta Synclair.\n\n\"It's not fair,\" Synclair said. \"I was worried about her staying in the police custody; now she will be in the prison with criminal people.\"\n\n'Terrible mistake'\n\nPlummer's local MP, Karl Turner, said her case had been raised with British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt.\n\n\"I am hopeful that good sense will eventually prevail,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"This is a damning indictment actually of the Egyptian authorities, in the sense that good sense and fairness certainly hasn't prevailed in this case.\n\n\"This is a decent woman who has made a terrible mistake who shouldn't be incarcerated in any prison, never mind an Egyptian prison.\""}

He replaces Richard Rosenthal, who left in January to take a job as British Columbia's first independent police monitor.\n\nMitchell's staff of six will grow by two next year when he hires a third deputy monitor and a second research analyst.\n\nAlso, a staff ombudsman who has been working part time will begin working full time. Among other duties, Mitchell said, the ombudsman \"builds relationships with different communities throughout Denver.\"\n\nTo cover the increased staffing, the monitor's budget will climb to $853,600 in 2013, up from $626,700 this year.\n\nThe budget also includes about $15,000 that the Citizen Oversight Board can use to evaluate Mitchell's performance.\n\nThe board, made up of seven members, oversees the monitor's office.\n\nFormer City Councilwoman Cathy Reynolds, a member of the board, said the staffing increase was sorely needed. \"We actually are going to be fully staffed for the first time in years.\"\n\nAmong other things, Mitchell and his two deputy monitors sit in on interviews performed by Denver's Internal Affairs Bureau, and Mitchell recommends discipline, up to and including termination, to Manager of Safety Alex Martinez, who heads the departments and the Denver Fire Department.\n\nThe additional deputy will make it easier to staff investigations around the clock, including when critical incidents such as police-involved shootings take place, Mitchell said. It will also give him more time to work on \"big-picture policy issues\" and community outreach, he said.\n\nThe new analyst will make it possible for the office, which was created in 2005, to do more research on policies and other matters, Reynolds said. \"We are very excited about that.\"\n\nMitchell, 37, wouldn't say what policies he will recommend the departments change \u2014 only that he wants to make adjustments to improve services to the community and raise residents' confidence level in law enforcement.\n\nRosenthal was roundly disliked by police, who said he overstepped the bounds of his office. His annual and quarterly reports often contained analysis and conclusions that rankled cops. Also, discipline being meted out toughened on his watch.\n\nThey were particularly angered when Rosenthal and the Citizen Oversight Board clashed with then-Safety Manager Ron Perea, saying publicly that discipline that Perea gave in two excessive-force cases was too light.\n\nIn his last report before leaving, Rosenthal accused members of the Internal Affairs Bureau of favoring the officers they investigated and called the bureau incapable of policing cops.\n\nUniversity of Nebraska professor emeritus Samuel Walker,\n\nwho has studied policing and citizen oversight for 20 years, said Rosenthal did a good job of monitoring law enforcement misconduct. He called reports that Rosenthal issued making note of problem areas and recommendations to fix them \"impressive.\"\n\nIncreasing focus on policy can lead to further improvements in policing, said Walker, who has written 11 books on policing, criminal justice history and policy, and civil liberties.\n\n\"There have been some agencies that got bogged down in individual cases, and that consumes an enormous amount of time, and you are bogged down in looking at symptoms rather than causes,\" Walker said.\n\nWhy make an officer who is following policy the \"fall guy\" when the problem could be training, a poor use of force policy or lousy supervision, Walker said.\n\nSafety Manager Martinez labeled Rosenthal's last report \"nitpicky\" and said none of the points he raised would have changed the outcome of the investigations.\n\nBut Police Chief Robert White, who took over the department shortly before Rosenthal left, replaced the head of the Internal Affairs Bureau and the division's staff as part of an ongoing department shake-up.\n\nWhite said at the time that questions Rosenthal had raised about IAB played a part in his decision to overhaul the bureau.\n\nNick Rogers, president of the Denver Police Protective Association, said Mitchell has done nothing to upset the union's members since taking over the office in August.\n\nAnd Mitchell, who grew up in a South Brooklyn neighborhood where crime was no stranger, said he values police protection.\n\nConversations the two have had have been productive, Rogers said.\n\nMitchell's style is less confrontational than that of his predecessor, Reynolds said.\n\n\"Richard was always just a little-pit-bull-in-a-fighting-match kind of guy. Nick is a little different in that way, a little more measured in his approach,\" said Reynolds. \"It's not a value judgment either way; they are just very different.\"\n\nMitchell, who was once an investigator for the New York City Civilian Compl"}

They were more convenient to swap out than the older system but far more expensive.\n\nAt some point despite growing LP sales, Allsop once again stopped producing and selling the Orbitrac. I had been discussing the re-introduction of the Orbitrac with Brent Allsop, even to the point of offering to buy the rights and manufacture it myself, when Mr. Allsop was tragically killed in an automobile accident.\n\nRecently a U.K. based reader sent me the closest thing to an Orbitrac I've yet seen. It's called a \"HyperBRUSH\u2122\" and it's manufactured in Ireland and marketed by TRACKMate\u2122. Though the company lists a U.S. distributor in Vancouver, WA. I could find no contact information and the product doesn't seem to be distributed in America.\n\nThe utterly clueless company markets a VHS cleaner and other such products on amazon.com but not the HyperBRUSH record cleaner. However, I did find it on Amazon.UK. for \u00a39 (about $18).\n\nIt works similar to the Orbitrac and comes with a record cleaning solution that I didn't try. It also has a stylus cleaning pad that works well and another felt pad atop the cleaner that's not identified for any purpose. In fact the instructions don't identify the stylus cleaning brush and I bet some inexperienced users might use the felt pad instead of the one that's supposed to be used. Of course you won't make that mistake.\n\nThe HyperBRUSH doesn't replace a good wet cleaning system whether the inexpensive Spin Clean or a vacuum machine or the Audio Desk ultrasonic machine. However, the HyperBRUSH is very useful as a pre-clean for really dirty records when used with any of the wet machines so you don't gum up and foul the machine brushes.\n\nThe HyperBRUSH also includes a static reducing strip. Unfortunately the brushes aren't replaceable. The company says washing them with warm soapy water (followed by a very good rinse) will restore them but I've not yet reached that point with the one I've got here. Plus I have the original Orbitrac and enough replacement pads to last a lifetime (thanks to a barter deal with a reader).\n\nOverall, I found the HyperBRUSH convenient to use on the turntable thanks to the over-the-spindle rotating feature and considering the low price, it's a worthwhile tool in one's record cleaning arsenal."}

Another former senior US intelligence official said the threat of illegal eavesdropping may be more theoretical than actual.\n\nOn Monday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers referred to alleged instances of \"beaconing\" of information to China, though he did not name any specific users of Huawei's equipment that had been affected.\n\nIn Britain, the Chinese firm's gear sits at the core of BT's national phone network and is being used to build 4G mobile broadband networks."}

For example, in winter of 2017, when the average temperature was 2.95 degree Celsius higher than the 1901-30 baseline, the worst drought in a century happened in southern India, in which Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala were worst-hit, with 330 million coming in the grip of drought,\" the CSE study said.\n\nIt pointed out that 13 of the 15 warmest years were in the past 15 years (2002-16) and the last decade (2001-10 and 2007-16) were the warmest on record. It said the annual mean temperature in India had risen by about 1.2 degrees since the beginning of the 20th century.\n\n\"Annual mean temperature in India has rapidly increased since 1995. At this rate of increase, it will breach the 1.5 degrees mark within the next two decades.\"\n\nEfforts to restrict the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius was the aspirational target set under the Paris Agreement.\n\n\"With the US exiting the Paris Agreement, controlling emissions and temperature is now a tougher task for the world. We appeal to the global community to come together and take strong actions,\" said Sunita Narain, the CSE Director General.\n\nThe study asserted that in three out of four seasons (or nine months in a year), temperature in India had already increased by more than 1.5 degree Celsius since the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nIt is only during the monsoon months that the temperature increase is about one degree.\n\nThe CSE said that while 2016 was the second warmest year in India, the summers of 2010, when the average temperature was 2.05 degrees higher than the baseline, was the highest in recorded history.\n\n\"These conditions claimed more than 300 lives. In addition, four cyclonic storms hit India that year (2010).\n\n\"India is warming and warming rapidly.

It might even be changing the way Americans think about race: Sixty percent now say there is more work to be done to give white and black people equal rights, up from 46 percent last year.\n\nHow did three words launch a modern-day civil rights movement? The phrase was coined in 2013, in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of the black 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. San Francisco-based Alicia Garza, an organizer with the National Domestic Workers' Alliance, took to social media after the news broke to write a love letter to black people on her Facebook page\u2014a simple plea to come together in recognition that \"black lives matter.\" Her friend Patrisse Cullors, head of an advocacy organization for incarcerated people, repeated the line on her own social media accounts, this time adding a hashtag. Soon enough, the pair, along with their tech-savvy friend Opal Tometi, director of the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, had lit up the Web with a plea to acknowledge\u2014and fix\u2014the disproportionate apprehension, imprisonment and killing of black Americans by the police.\n\nWhile it started out as a way to mobilize demonstrations from New York to St. Louis in response to police violence against African-Americans, Black Lives Matter today has 26 chapters in the United States, Britain and Ghana, and represents a broad agenda of economic equality and criminal justice reform. The group connects activists and organizes protests\u2014more than 900 to date\u2014in a single network that has advanced one of the most vocal and visible news stories of the year: the intersection of police abuse and racial injustice.\n\nSocial media movements are prone to skepticism, but it's hard to imagine recent progress on criminal justice\u2014from the White House task force on policing to the Justice Department's body camera initiative\u2014happening without public pressure amplified by Black Lives Matter. In April, when a bystander captured footage of a cop shooting a fleeing black man in North Charleston, South Carolina, he turned to a Black Lives Matter member to help share the video. The officer was arrested and indicted for murder.\n\nNow, these three words are a sticking point in the 2016 presidential race. Ever since Democratic candidate Martin O'Malley declared that \"all lives matter,\" protesters identifying with the Black Lives Matter movement have stormed campaign events (or tried to) for O'Malley, Jeb Bush, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders to demand that the candidates acknowledge, and confront, institutional racism. (O'Malley later apologized.) Clinton, for one, says she is embracing the movement. \"We need to acknowledge some hard truths about race and justice,\" she wrote on her Facebook page this summer. \"Black lives matter.\""}

A cyclic retro-inverted peptidomimetic, D(Cys-Leu-Pro-Arg-Cys) \u2013 also known as Vasotide \u2013 is the latest candidate for that role.\n\nVasotide works by selectively binding to the VEGF receptors VEGFR-1 and neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), and pilot studies performed in young mice with a retinopathy of prematurity-like phenotype showed that topical administration of the drug inhibited retinal angiogenesis (1). What's now been published are the results of preclinical evaluations in three animal models: a mouse oxygen-induced retinopathy, vldr-null mice (a mouse model of retinal angiomatous proliferation), and laser-induced choroidal neovascularization in Old World monkeys (2). In the latter experiment, topically-formulated Vasotide was administered twice daily from day 1 through day 5 after laser photocoagulation, then once daily on days 6 through 21. On retinal assessment at day 29, Vasotide use was associated with a significant (p<0.0001) reduction in the development of grade III and IV lesions compared with monkeys treated with vehicle alone \u2013 an outcome comparable to those achieved by ranibizumab or bevacizumab in this model.\n\nIn addition to the obvious benefits of a topical route of administration, the researchers hope that the fact that Vasotide targets NRP-1 in addition to VEGF-A, the drug might offer an alternative to patients who respond poorly to current treatments. In terms of the future potential of the drug, first author, Richard Sidman said, \"In addition to future clinical trials on AMD and ROP, we think that diabetic retinopathy and certain forms of cancer may also prove to be responsive to Vasotide.\"\n\nWelcome back,\n\nYou are already logged in Enjoy our FREE content!

(Thatcher, 2004; Yoshiyuki, 1989) Biogeographic Regions\n\noriental native\n\nOther Geographic Terms\n\nisland endemic\n\nHabitat Ryukyu flying-foxes use forests for daytime roosting. Terrestrial Biomes\n\nforest\n\nrainforest\n\nPhysical Description Ryukyu flying-foxes are in the suborder Megachiroptera. Key characteristics of this suborder are that they have a well developed premaxillary bone, a postorbital process is present, they lack a tragus and a noseleaf, and their teeth are adapted for eating fruit. There are 5 subspecies of Ryukyu flying-foxes. They are P. d. daitoensis (Daito fruit bat), P. d. dasymallus (Erabu fruit bat), P. d. formosus (Taiwanese fruit bat), P. d. inopinatus (Orii's fruit bat), and P. d. yayeyamae (Yaeyama fruit bat). There are some character variations among the subspecies. Pteropus dasymallus daitoensis has brown wings and a yellow belly and back. The sides of the back are brown. The body is 221 mm long and forearm length 134 mm. Pteropus dasymallus dasymallus is the largest in size and darkest in color of the subspecies. The fur coloration consists of a blackish head and face, body is usually dark brown to black, and a cream colored area around neck. The forearm measured at around 137 mm. Pteropus dasymallus formosus is thought to be extinct in the wild. Pteropus dasymallus inopinatus has a brown muzzle, and it has a patch of darker fur that interrupts the white collar around its neck. Pteropus dasymallus inopinatus has an exposed lacrimal foramen. Pteropus dasymallus yayeyamae is the smallest in size among the 4 wild subspecies. The fur color varies on the dorsal and ventral sides of this subspecies. The head is usually brown and the neck a cinnamon color.

Flowers are eaten in the spring and leaves year round. Insects may also be a part of the diet of this species in the summer and autumn. One study showed that P. d. dasymallus has a more diverse diet than any other pteropodid bats ever studied. Their diet includes bark, 17 species of fruit, nine species of leaves, five species of flowers, and eight species of insects on Kuchinoerabu Island. (Thatcher, 2004; Thatcher, 2004) Primary Diet"}

These odd-looking snails are seen coiled on rocks, stones and other hard surfaces. Commonly seen on our Northern shores. Some snails of the Family Turritellidae also build coiling shells.\n\n\nFeatures: Tube opening 1-2cm in diameter, coils 10cm long or more. This amazing snail is NOT a worm. It builds a thin hard tube on hard surfaces. The worm snail has a pair of short thick tentacles, and a short foot. Some species of worm snails have a thin operculum attached to the foot that is used to seal the shell opening, others don't. As young snails, the shell they produce appears 'normal', and are free-living and unattached. But they soon attach to a hard surface and the shell produced becomes meandering and coiling.\n\n\nSometimes confused with keelworms (Phylum Annelida, Class Polychaeta) which are segmented worms that also build coiling hard shells on hard surfaces. Tubes made by worms such as keelworms are dull on the inside and made up of two layers. Tube worms have segmented bodies. Tubes made by snails such as vermetids are glossy on the inside because of a deposit of nacre, and made up of three layers. Vermetid snails do not have segmented bodies. Here's more on how to tell apart animals that make hard coiling tubes.\n\n\nWhat does it eat? A worm snail 'nets' food from the water. A sticky mucus net is secreted from a gland near the foot. This net can extend many times the body length. Elsewhere, it was observed that a vermetid snail with a tube diameter of 5cm had a mucus net 2m long! The animal gathers the mucus and eats it together with whatever tasty bits are stuck on it. The vermetid snail's digestive system is more similar to that of bivalves than other gastropods.\n\n\nWorm snail babies: Male worm snails release their sperm in packets. Female worm snails 'net' these sperm packets in the same way that they gather food. As the sperm packets are hauled near the female's body, the sperm is released from the packet. Or the female may store the sperm to fertilise the eggs later. Eggs are retained inside the tube. They don't have a free-swimming stage and emerge out of the tube as little snails. After crawling about briefly, they cement themselves to a hard surface.\n\n\nHuman uses: In Polynesia, they are a traditional food of some coastal people.\n\n\nPulau Sekudu, Jul 05\n\n\nPunggol, Jun 12\n\n\nFeeding with mucus strands?\n\nRaffles Marina, Jun 02"}

Marketers today \u2014 and especially in large organizations \u2014 often still base their marketing effort on what they learned during the desktop era. \"But this is about understanding the customer journey all the way to conversion,\" Pahlavan explained.\n\nThe service, which consists of these six different applications that are all tightly integrated with each other, is meant to help marketers engage with the right users at the right time and help advertisers understand their customers' journeys better.\n\nThe guiding philosophy behind all the new tools was to ensure that they were easy to use, even as they pull in vast amounts of data, and provide marketers with actionable information and not just a barrage of data.\n\n\"If you have very complex tools, they don't get used,\" Pahlavan noted. \"We focus on simplicity. How can we make tools that are extremely easy to use and that make it easy to collaborate?\"\n\nSo what's in this suite? One of the cornerstones of the product is clearly Google Analytics 360 \u2014 the rebranded version of Google Analytics Premium. It's where all the measurement data Google collects comes together, after all.\n\nOn top of that, though, Google is also launching Audience Center 360, a data management platform that will be integrated with Google's own tools (including DoubleClick) but that can also pull in data from third-party providers.\n\nWith Optimize 360, another completely new product, Google will now make it easier for marketers to run A/B tests on their sites to, for example, find the best version of a text snippet or image.\n\nThe most interesting of the completely new products, though, is probably Google Data Studio 360. This is where all the data visualization and analysis happens. Pahlavan tells me Data Studio was built on top of Google Doc's collaboration and sharing technology, but it is also powered by BigQuery \u2014 Google's data analytics platform.\n\nTag Manager, Analytics and Attribution are all rebranded versions of existing tools that will now get additional features (and in the case of Adometry, Google says Attribution has been \"rebuilt from the ground up\"). Most of these changes are scheduled to roll out over the next couple of months.\n\nThe four new products in the suite (Audience Center, Data Studio, Optimize and Tag Manager) are now in limited beta. Current Google Analytics Premium and Adometry users will should see an invite to join the new betas in the coming months."}

We do work, email friends, find restaurants, watch videos and movies, and check the weather. And the Internet is increasingly used for important services, like video medical consults and online education, and is relied upon by businesses for critical operations.\n\nUnder a recent court decision, Internet service providers, primarily cable companies, aren't required to treat all websites equally. They can make deals to provide faster service to some, or slow down sites that refuse to pay them extra fees. Law professor Susan Crawford says you may be experiencing the effects of this \u2014 without realizing it.\n\nWhy, for example, do you have to wait for YouTube videos to buffer? Crawford explains: \"You may think it's the YouTube application. You may think there is something wrong with your computer. It's probably the network provider making life unpleasant for YouTube because YouTube has refused to pay in order to cross its wires to reach you. And we'll be seeing much more of that kind of activity in the future.\"\n\nCrawford, author of Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the Gilded Age, explains how we got to this point. \"The [Federal Communications Commission] in the early 2000s really thought that competition would do the job of regulatory oversight \u2014 that that would protect Americans,\" she tells Fresh Air's Dave Davies. The idea was that cable, telephone and wireless companies would battle it out, which would yield low prices for American consumers. \"As it turns out, they were wrong and we've come into an era where these markets have consolidated and for most Americans, their only choice for high-speed, high-capacity Internet connection is their local cable monopoly.\"\n\nCrawford says that American Internet service is falling behind other nations because cable companies have such dominance in many markets, and that will undermine our ability to compete in a global economy. She warns: \"Unless somebody in the system has industrial policy in mind, a long-term picture of where the United States needs to be and has the political power to act on it, we'll be a Third World country when it comes to communications.\"\n\nInterview Highlights\n\nOn how the Internet is like the railroad\n\nFor every part of our modern lives we depend on information flows coming into our houses and our businesses. They're just like the railroad in that if you were a farmer in the 1890s, the only way to get your goods to market would be to work through the railroad. ... We just can't operate without it. They're also like them in that they're expensive businesses to build in the first place \u2014 it's very hard to come in and compete against one of these guys once they've built one of these giant networks. They're also like the railroad in that it takes intentional policy to make them stretch all the way across the United States. We wouldn't have had the transcontinental railroad without Lincoln; we wouldn't have had the federal highway system without Eisenhower; because markets, left alone, don't provide this kind of universal access.\n\nOn why communications access shouldn't be treated as a luxury\n\nWe seem to have forgotten that when it comes to these utility basic services, we can't create a level playing field for all Americans or indeed compete on the world stage without having some form of government involvement.\n\nI think the problem is actually much more profound than mere discrimination by a few cable actors when it comes to high-speed Internet access. We seem to currently assume that communications access is a luxury, something that should be entirely left to the private market unconstrained by any form of oversight. The problem is that it's just not true in the modern era. You can't get a job, you can't get access to adequate health care, you can't educate your children, we can't keep up with other countries in the developed world without having very high capacity, very high speed access for everybody in the country. And the only way you get there is through government involvement in this market. That's how we did it for the telephone, that's how we did it for the federal highway system, and we seem to have forgotten that when it comes to these utility basic services, we can't create a level playing field for all Americans or indeed compete on the world stage without having some form of government involvement.\n\nOn the recent lawsuit between Verizon and the FCC\n\nVerizon was irritated at the December 2010 open Internet rules that had been adopted by the FCC, and [it] came before the D.C. Circuit [court] saying, \"Look, we'd like to be able to charge actors like Netflix and Google additional amounts to cross our wires to reach our subscribers, and to pick subscribers to charge more, too, depending on how much"}

{"id": 259367, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Smoking is back in pubs, Neil Hamilton is deputy PM and there are raids for illegal immigrants in curry houses \u2013 there is not much sophistication in this political satire\n\nThe rapid rise of Ukip is a topic rife for discussion, but the danger of the party's relative popularity is that it changes the discourse of the other parties, not that it might actually form a government. Film-maker Chris Atkins, writer/director of the excellent Starsuckers, fuses fairytale with real news footage in Ukip: The First 100 Days (Channel 4), which imagines a near future in which Prime Minister Nigel Farage gains a slender majority at the general election. Atkins' story is pegged on the fledgling career of the newly elected fictional MP for Romford, Deepa Kaur, played with impressive commitment by Priyanga Burford, who does her best to make Kaur a three-dimensional human, striving to do good as her party seeks to exploit those good intentions. It is a great performance \u2013 but the fictional Britain that votes for a Ukip government doesn't convince nearly as much.\n\nDeepa begins as an idealist who thinks her chosen party offers a better future. \"We are taking everyone to a better place,\" she says in a bid to convince her doubting brother of her integrity. In a convenient bit of plotting, he loses his job at the local factory when the new government pulls Britain out of the European Union and practically leads a hashtag campaign to #savesabir, a young man injured in one of the government's heavy-handed illegal immigrant raids.\n\nChannel 4's Ukip docudrama prompts nearly 1,000 complaints Read more\n\nKaur is a Sikh, born in Britain, complete with stereotypically proud parents who show off her university certificates to anyone who'll listen. She quickly becomes Ukip's reassuringly \"brown face\" as she puts it, fronting a new immigration clamp-down. Smoking is back in pubs, Neil Hamilton is deputy PM, and funding is increased for border control task forces, with ex-squaddies raiding curry house kitchens looking for stowaways. Meanwhile, the anti-Ukip factions mobilise and march on London, clashing with right-wing groups. The government papers over the cracks by announcing a new bank holiday and a revived Festival of Britain, but, as the country tips towards bedlam, the bunting droops and the scones start to look stale.\n\nFor a show about political maneuvering it's not exactly House of Cards or The Thick of It, but Ukip: The First 100 Days nevertheless tries to depict a Machiavellian spin doctor (played by Jamie Glassman) who literally lurks in the shadows as he grooms Deepa for political stardom. Those used to more sophistication in their political satire (and it does attempt a satirical tone) might be disappointed by the rather binary nature of this tale. It just stops short of depicting a grinning Farage holding up the smoking doorknob of No 10, grinning apologetically among its ruins like a wretched Frank Spencer while chaos descends around him. Atkins points out that Farage hasn't thought things through and that his knee-jerk, fear-based policies will result in a climate of hate and economic chaos. It's a good point, but not exactly an original one.\n\nDeepa's eventual redemption comes in the form of all-out rebellion: in the final scene she performs a u-turn, ruining her chances of promotion. While her political future was left unclear, she does earn a hug from her left-wing brother, telling us she is at least, morally speaking, a high achiever. What could have been a nuanced look at a British political phenomenon, ends up not just pat, but feeling like a giant pat on the head. It won't aid Ukip's cause in the run up to the election, but it probably won't make much of a dent in it either.\n\nIn another vision of Britain, Robson Green returns for a second series of his Tales from Northumberland (ITV) in which the endlessly enthusiastic actor asks us to join him in celebration of Victorians, dolphins and naked swimmers while swooping over north east England in a quite unnecessary helicopter.\n\nThis is the ITV template for popular factual series now: familiar person goes to a place, sees things through an affable layman's filter, generally looks happy to be there, even though it's not clear why they are. \"I truly believe these creatures are put on the planet just to make your heart sing,\" Green froths as a dolphin frolics off the starboard bow. Or perhaps even just to guest star in documentaries presented by well-loved actors discussing subjects far outside their area of expertise.\n\nAnd in case any viewers were feeling short-changed at the endless scenes of Green yomping from beach to ancient pile in durable waterproofs, he obligingly strips off for a dip in the sea with some wild swimming enthusiasts in Druridge Bay.

With the #8 pick in this year's draft, the Sabres should have their pick of a number of excellent prospects to add to their young pool of talent, and in the annual SB Nation mock draft, we chose to add another talented forward with some Atlantic Division connections.\n\nWith the #8 pick in the 2016 SBN mock draft, the Buffalo Sabres (and Die By The Blade) select Alexander Nylander.\n\nAlex Nylander, RW/LW, Mississauga Steelheads (OHL)\n\n2015-16 Regular Season: 57 GP, 28-47-75\n\n2015-16 Playoffs: 6 GP, 6-6-12\n\nNylander brings speed and skill to the forward ranks of a Sabres organization still in need of that, despite their recent acquisitions. He has a game similar to Sam Reinhart - with high marks in vision, playmaking ability, puck control, and Hockey IQ. He also has some similar concerns about needing to add more muscle to thrive in the NHL, currently measuring in at 6'0'' and about 175 lbs, but as this season went along he improved on his ability to battle for space with and without the puck, and certainly has the family pedigree to know what it takes to play in the NHL. He's a right handed shot who's played plenty of left wing, so he's also a versatile player to plug in to the lineup.\n\nIn addition to his serious offensive skills, Nylander is also an excellent skater who scored the highest mark at the NHL Combine in a test that measures anaerobic peak power - essentially, one's ability to stay explosive even when tired. We know strong combine numbers catch Tim Murray's eye, and being a strong skater has become a prerequisite to being an NHL player these days. Nylander checks both of boxes in a big way, and when combined with his strong game sense and playmaking ability, you've got a prospect who can be a vital contributor among any team's top six forwards, and should find a place with Eichel and Reinhart as a key member of the Sabres new core.\n\nHow did we decide on Nylander?\n\nTo be honest, I was hoping for one of the two top defensemen to fall to Buffalo at #8, either Olli Juolevi or Jakob Chychrun, but with those two off the board already, our choice came down to defenseman Mikhail Sergachev or Nylander. Sergachev would be a nice addition to a Sabres blue line that needs another contributor next season, and he will bring both tenacity and offensive skill to whichever team drafts him. It's also worth noting that the Sabres reportedly had 20 people at his combine interview, so you know the team has him on their radar.\n\nBut Nylander would bring two unique aspects to the Sabres organization. The first is the obvious connection - his brother William Nylander plays for the Toronto Maple Leafs, and by drafting Alex, the Sabres and Leafs would add another juicy aspect to a rivalry between two young, growing teams. The second interesting thing about Nylander is that he is immediately eligible to play in the AHL next season. Since he was on loan to Mississauga this season, he's still technically under contract in Sweden, so he isn't bound to the same AHL restrictions that under-20 players face thanks to the CHL-NHL agreement. That means he could play for the Amerks next season, and potentially be a call up should the Sabres choose to do so.\n\nThe draft so far\n\nFollow the rest of SBN's mock draft here, and give us your thoughts on our pick of Alex Nylander in the comments."}

He warns that the ability of British people to travel as freely as they do now, and to work and buy homes in other EU countries, would also be lost, and that UK businesses would suddenly face new problems, as the country would no longer be able to influence the rules of the internal market.\n\nTrzaskowski, reflecting growing fears in the EU that the UK government is setting itself unrealistic targets for reform which British people are being led to believe are achievable, says all European leaders want Britain to stay in the EU, but not if it means undermining EU principles, such as the free movement of labour. \"No one in Europe says, 'We don't care, take it or leave it.' No, we say, 'Guys, OK, some of your fears are justified, some of your sensibilities should be taken into account, and some of your idiosyncrasies, even though for us they might seem strange. We should talk about it.' We do not say ship out. But there are certain red lines. We cannot start questioning the cornerstones of integration, because it will have far-reaching consequences.\"\n\nAsked whether he fears the British people might vote to leave, he says: \"It really depends on how the whole thing is depicted by British political parties to the British people \u2013 what kind of alternative is painted. If you say you can leave and still be part of the internal market, keep your [second] houses, that you will still be free to travel, that there will be no customs duties, and so on \u2013 but that you will not have to accept free movement of workers, and you will not pay into the EU budget, of course people will vote [to leave] \u2026 but this is simply not true.\"\n\nTrzaskowski adds: \"If Great Britain leaves, it will minimise its role. I am not trying to be patronising. I think we have to be frank with the British people when we talk about their future in the European Union. Many people in Europe want to be accommodating \u2026 but if the demands are too extreme, they are not going to be met.\n\n\"You cannot keep all the goodies and forget about the costs. Britain will still have to pay into the EU budget, just as the Swiss and Norwegians do. It would have no influence over the decisions yet it would have to subscribe to all the rules. London would not be that sexy a place for capital movement because it would have much looser links to Europe.\"\n\nGerman chancellor Angela Merkel suggested last week that her country would do all in its power to try to meet British demands during a wide-ranging renegotiation of its membership ahead of the referendum. But it is understood that Berlin also believes that the key British demand \u2013 to deny migrants who are in work the same social benefits as UK residents \u2013 would amount to a fundamental breach of EU law.\n\nCameron is now urging fellow European leaders to reach an outline deal on the UK's demands, which also include an opt-out from the EU commitment to \"ever-closer union\", by the end of this year, in time for the referendum to be held next year. Should he fail to secure reform on his terms, more than 50 Tory MPs are poised to lead the campaign for the UK to quit the EU. Former cabinet ministers Owen Paterson and John Redwood are among backers of the newly formed Conservatives for Britain (CfB) that will initially support the prime minister's bid to renegotiate terms of membership for the UK, according to the Sunday Telegraph.\n\nPoland, whose economy has strengthened since it joined the EU in 2004, now sees itself as a central player in the union and is determined to defend the rights of the 700,000 Polish citizens in the UK, the vast majority of whom are in work.\n\nTrzaskowski says that just because Cameron feels strengthened by his general election victory, Poland will not roll over. \"We cannot say simply that we sit around the table and you say, 'This is my manifesto and"}

It can only be a matter for speculation as to who else may have seen the images, and whether those images have been stored in such a manner which, at a time the complainant least expects, they will again be available for viewing, circulation or distribution.''\n\nUsmanov's lawyer, Maggie Sten, had argued his was not a ''serious offense,'' to which Mottley fired back: ''What could be more serious than publishing nude photographs of a woman on the internet, what could be more serious?''\n\nShe added: ''It's one thing to publish an article in print form with limited circulation. That may affect the objective seriousness of the offense but once it goes on the worldwide web via Facebook it effectively means it's open to anyone who has some link in any way, however remotely.''\n\nMore from GlobalPost: Meet the people behind Turkey's 'miracle'"}

Some say it's about standing up to aggression and halting a dictator's march.\n\nSome say it's about the future of everything-from Syria to North Korea to Iran's nuclear program - and, according to Sen. Lindsey Graham, it all stems from Obama's failure to kill the people who killed Americans at Benghazi.\n\nBut the most-revealing voice in the chorus is Condi Rice. She penned a tension-filled op-ed on Ukraine for the Washington Post - the newspaper of broken records.\n\nHer nostalgic, \"Baby, It's a Cold War Outside\" ditty on the \"Ukrainian Problem\" came just two days after a Teflon-coated Henry Kissinger opined about the \"art of establishing priorities\" in his own Ukraine-themed op-ed for the Post.\n\nWhy should we care about Condi?\n\nAs the world learned through painful experience, Condi Rice, much like Henry Kissinger, was all about establishing priorities. But now that she's out of power, why should anyone waste any time considering Ms. Rice's opinion about anything, much less about the 'crisis' in Ukraine?\n\nWhy? Because it's telling. Like most American Exceptionalists, her bluster and posturing can be reverse-engineered to find the banal truth about US foreign policy.\n\nFor example, her steadfast belief that Ukraine \"should not be a pawn in a great-power conflict but rather an independent nation\" might have something to do with Chevron's 50-year lease to develop Ukraine's shale gas reserves.\n\nIt's the gas, stupid\n\nWhen that lease was signed on November 5, 2013, it stoked Russian fears about losing its influence on, and a major gas market in, a former satellite.\n\nIt also came on the eve of the much-disputed trade deal with the European Union that, once abandoned due to Russian pressure, led to the toppling of Ukraine's government.\n\nReuters characterized Ukraine's \"$10 billion shale gas production-sharing agreement with US Chevron\" as \"another step in a drive for more energy independence from Russia.\"\n\nOf course, Ms. Rice knows something about driving for more energy. She sat on Chevron's board of directors for ten years before resigning to become President Bush's National Security Adviser in January of 2001.\n\nShe was such a titanic figure at Chevron and so beloved by their corporate captains that they even named a 129,000-ton oil tanker 'Condoleezza Rice'. Do people name tankers after people? People do!\n\nBut four months after leaving Chevron, they \"quietly renamed\" the tanker, apparently sensitive to the implication that she might prioritize their interests in places like Kazakhstan (a de facto dictatorship never targeted by American Exceptionalists) or the Caspian Sea (where Chevron is heavily invested) or Afghanistan (where they've long sought a pipeline from the Caspian region to the Indian Ocean).\n\nCorporate Interests Abroad\n\nIn the case of Ukraine, Chevron's deal continues a long tradition of intermarriage between 'national' and corporate interests under the guise of national security.\n\nAs the International Business Times stated immediately after the deal, \"Chevron's agreement with Ukraine was supported by the US as part of its national security strategy to help reduce Russia's hold on Europe and Kiev.\"\n\nAs quoted in the article, US Ambassador Geoffrey Pyatt said, \"I'm very determined to cooperate with the Ukrainian government in strengthening Ukraine's energy independence.\"\n\nThat \"cooperation\" is couched in the language of \"independence\" - but it's actually about shifting to financial interdependence with powerful, American corporate interests. It's not about freedom or self-determination or human rights.\n\nIt's about the 'Open Door'.\n\nSince the US proposed the Open Door Policy in China at the end of the 19th Century, American 'soft imperialism' has exploited resource opportunities for American corporate interests in dozens of 'friendly'regimes - their commitment to freedom notwithstanding.\n\nWe have been there before\n\nWhether it was oil in Iran, bananas in Guatemala or sugar-cane in Cuba, any move to close the door on US business interests has traditionally been met with dire warnings about the dangers of isolationism and specious claims about America's national interests - which, oddly enough, always seem to be located in another country.\n\nThroughout the Cold War, those 'endangered' national interests inspired CIA hijinks around the world. US foreign policymakers supported regime change in places like Chile (calling Dr. Kissinger) and around Central America.\n\nAnd they doled out generous foreign aid packages to a motley crew of anti-communist 'strongmen'.

New data from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) shows an increase in both the number of active conflicts but also in the number of battle-related deaths in these conflicts.\n\nIn 2014, the conflict in Syria and the escalating violence in countries like Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Ukraine, resulted in the highest yearly death toll in the post-Cold War period.\n\nIn an article in the Journal of Peace Research, the UCDP describes the recent trend in armed conflicts and battle-related deaths. During 2014, 40 armed conflicts, causing at least 25 battle-related deaths, were active. After the end of the Cold War, the number of conflicts in the world decreased substantially. However, for the last ten years the UCDP has recorded an uneven, yet clearly visible upward trend. In particular, the number of conflicts involving troops from other states, so called internationalized conflicts, has increased.\n\n'Nevertheless, this ten-year period is also where we find the year with the lowest number of active conflicts in the post-Cold War period', says Ther\u00e9se Pettersson, project leader at the UCDP. 'This illustrates the variations in the number of conflicts, and the difficulties of speaking of the long term trend'.\n\nThe number of conflicts which are defined as wars, resulting in at least 1000 battle-related deaths per year, has also increased, from six in 2013 to 11 in 2014. This represents the largest relative increase since the early 1960s. In recent years, the number of battle-related deaths has increased dramatically, largely due to the developments in Syria. In 2014, the UCDP recorded the highest number of battle-related deaths since the end of the Cold War.\n\n'Besides Syria, we have also seen violence escalating in several other conflicts, such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria and Ukraine', Ther\u00e9se Pettersson says. 'Even when excluding Syria, 2014 witnessed the highest number of battle-related deaths in 15 years'.\n\nOne positive development is that 10 peace agreements were signed during 2014, four more than in 2013.\n\n'We have for example seen a historic agreement signed in the Philippines', says Peter Wallensteen, UCDP's Director.

The Northeast Alberta Street art walk had become an all-night party, with visitors peeing and defecating on residents' lawns. About 300 people crowded the Acadian Ballroom to brainstorm solutions.\n\nAmong those who rose in defense of Last Thursday was an 8-year-old who said she'd earned $70 playing her violin at the freewheeling street fair.\n\n\"She was putting her hopes and dreams out on that street,\" O'Connor said recently.\n\nThe monthly event has only grown bigger and rowdier since 2010. But O'Connor, 29, has a plan to restore Last Thursday to an atmosphere where an 8-year-old street musician can flourish. His solution, coming from an events promoter, might sound surprising: Eliminate about half the visitors.\n\n\"It just got too big, which created a problem,\" he said. \"There is a tipping point to good things. It's tough when you've passed that point to come back, but I'm willing to take the risk.\"\n\nO'Connor's determined risk-taking has already run him afoul of city staff. When he declared last month that he was forming a nonprofit to run the event and collect fees, officials told him he had no authority to do so. His written response: \"I don't need your authority.\"\n\nO'Connor is in for an uphill battle. Returning Last Thursday to its glory days will take time, money and many, many uncomfortable conversations. But the 8-year-old violinist represents the best of what Portland once was, O'Connor says -- and the best of what it can still be.\n\nLast Thursday to Hump Day\n\nLike other activists who have tried to preserve Last Thursday, O'Connor is an artist. He creates sculptures for music festivals, earns about $20 an hour doing special events for Kruger Farms, and recently started designing corn mazes for farmers.\n\nO'Connor grew up in Beaverton, but now lives near Southeast Belmont Street. He has pale blue eyes and a floppy blonde haircut that makes him look like Michael Pitt, the heartthrob indie actor who starred in Hedwig and the Angry Inch and Boardwalk Empire.\n\nHe started going to Last Thursday when he lived off Alberta because it was free entertainment.\n\n\"You never knew what you would see,\" he said. \"But you knew it was going to be a spectacle every time.\"\n\nBy 2010, vendors and neighbors agreed: The spectacles had become too wild. After the meeting at the Acadian, O'Connor joined a volunteer group called Friends of Last Thursday that wanted to bring some order. But group members didn't get along -- with each other or with city officials. They saw five conflict resolution mediators that year, O'Connor said.\n\n\"Nobody had the experience of this level of event production,\" he said. \"It wasn't gearing up for a peaceful resolution.\"\n\nBy 2012, O'Connor felt hopeless.\n\n\"He had a hard time being a team player or following through to make an idea happen,\" said Maquette Reeves, the head of Friends of Last Thursday.\n\nHe quit the group and created a new monthly art fair on Belmont Street. The fair, called Hump Day, attracted about 1,500 visitors.\n\n\"He always had a new idea and a new way to do something,\" said Michelle Purvis, a painter who first met O'Connor when she was selling acrylics at Last Thursday.\n\nShe followed him to Hump Day. When winter brought rain, O'Connor organized painting parties.\n\n\"He had great energy,\" Purvis said. \"Twenty to 50 people would get together and paint and talk about art.\"\n\nTaking over\n\nStill, O'Connor kept thinking about Last Thursday. The remaining members of Friends of Last Thursday quit in 2013, and the city took over managing the event.\n\nMayor Charlie Hales ordered the event closed at 9 p.m. this year.

According to Mayor de Blasio and Police Commissioner Bratton, the NYPD will continue to strictly enforce laws against loosie peddlers and subway dancers. \"I can understand why any New Yorker may say, that's not such a big offense,\" de Blasio said. \"But a violation of the law is a violation of the law.\"\n\nCommissioner Bratton added, \"We need the public's help also to appreciate that when an officer does approach you to correct your behavior, that you respond. That's what democracy is all about.\"\n\nThe pair were speaking at a press conference to discuss the reforms they're putting in place after Garner's death, including a planned retraining of the entire NYPD, the CCRB study into chokeholds (\"Over the last two decades [the CCRB] has not played a particularly important role in this city, certainly not the role it was supposed to play,\" the mayor admitted), and continued conversations with community leaders.\n\nTimes reporter David Goodman asked what Bratton meant when he remarked shortly after his swearing-in that falling crime rates implied that \"the intrusion of police into citizens' lives should also diminish.\" Did this apply to open container laws and having two feet on the subway seat?\n\n\"I'm still trying to find the balance,\" Bratton said. \"I'm dealing with the Elmo craze in Times Square, or dealing with house parties you have 300 or 400 people showing up at 3 or 4 in the morning. We had three of those parties this past weekend that had extensive violence. At two of them people just started shooting. In the third instance, an AK-47 was found on the lawn when we responded.\"\n\nBratton added, \"Would you not want us to deal with that quality of life crime?\"\n\nLeft unsaid was the fact that the high number of minor marijuana arrests under Mayor Bloomberg's tenure have not budged since de Blasio took office. Bratton also responded to a bizarre question about \"onlooker interference\" in videos depicting police use of force (videos that were the subject of a recent federal lawsuit against the NYPD for violating citizens' rights, though the reporter didn't mention this).\n\n\"There is no denying that in some of the videos that what you see is interference on the part of onlookers, maybe relatives, maybe friends, who should not be interfering,\" Bratton said. \"That interference certainly exacerbates the situation.\"\n\nPretty stunning stat from NYPD transit bureau chief: 268 summonses, 94 arrests this year for \"littering violations\" in the transit system. \u2014 Matt Flegenheimer (@mattfleg) July 28, 2014\n\nEditor's Note: Due to a hasty transcription, we initially reported that Bratton said the following: \"It's important that when an officer does approach you to correct your behavior, that you respect them.

After today's game, here's where the Bruins D men were in terms of regular season ice time (all situations, via stats.hockeyanalysis) and their status. Three of those four injuries were to top four defenseman, and the fourth was to their sixth defenseman.\n\nLet's start with a quick rundown of the potential plays that injured the Bruins defensemen, and the dates\n\nGame 81 vs Ottawa Senators, April 6\n\nTorey Krug - Lower body\n\nDefensemen TOI:\n\nGame 82 vs Washington Capitals, April 8\n\nBrandon Carlo - Upper body\n\nDefensemen TOI:\n\nPlayoff Game 1 vs Ottawa Senators, April 12\n\nColin Miller - Lower body\n\nDefensemen TOI:\n\nPlayoff Game 2 vs Ottawa Senators, April 15\n\nAdam McQuaid - Upper Body\n\nDefensemen TOI:\n\nOver these past four games, the Bruins have been down to five defensemen for just under 80% of the time, with 179:29 out of a possible 257 minutes spend down a defenseman. The least amount of time in a game spent like this? The 45 minutes after Colin Miller's knee injury in game 1. He returned to the bench in the second period, but didn't take a shift past 15 minutes into the game. Which defensemen are eating up those minutes lost? Looking at the difference in their ice time the past four games compared to their regular season averages can give us a clue. Since Charlie McAvoy didn't play in any regular season games, we have nothing to compare him to, so whatever minutes he gives the Bruins is just found money.\n\nSome quick takeaways:\n\nCharlie McAvoy has gotten the trust of Cassidy, and fast. Although it's not like he's had any choice given his options on the right side\n\nKevan Miller has seen his ice time rise considerably, rising to Chara levels in the regular season\n\nChara has had a more measured increase in ice time, mainly because there's only so many more minutes he can play\n\nLooking back at the game two defensemen ice time, there was a clear top three that Cassidy leaned on, the two non injured top six defensemen from the regular season, and the fresh faced rookie, all over 27 minutes, with the fourth D man 7 minutes away, and the fifth defenseman at about half the ice time of the big three\n\nPretty obvious: They can't keep losing a defenseman every game, and they EVENTUALLY have to get one or two (Colin Miller and/or Brandon Carlo seem like the likely candidates, with Torey Krug the outside shot)\n\nI'll take the blame for McQuaid getting hurt. And I really hope I didn't jinx Kevan Miller as well, he's been solid."}

{"id": 259387, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "By Eric Beinhocker\n\nEconomic ideas matter. The writings of Adam Smith over two centuries ago still influence how people in positions of power \u2013 in government, business, and the media \u2013 think about markets, regulation, the role of the state, and other economic issues today. The words written by Karl Marx in the middle of the 19th century inspired revolutions around the world and provided the ideological foundations for the cold war. The Chicago economists, led by Milton Friedman, set the stage for the Reagan/Thatcher era and now fill Tea Partiers with zeal. The debates of Keynes and Hayek in the 1930s are repeated daily in the op-ed pages and blogosphere today.\n\nEconomic thinking is changing. If that thesis is correct \u2013 and there are many reasons to believe it is \u2013 then historical experience suggests policy and politics will change as well. How significant that change will be remains to be seen. It is still early days and the impact thus far has been limited. Few politicians or policymakers are even dimly aware of the changes underway in economics; but these changes are deep and profound, and the implications for policy and politics are potentially transformative.\n\nGet Evonomics in your inbox\n\nFor almost 200 years the politics of the west, and more recently of much of the world, have been conducted in a framework of right versus left \u2013 of markets versus states, and of individual rights versus collective responsibilities. New economic thinking scrambles, breaks up and re-forms these old dividing lines and debates. It is not just a matter of pragmatic centrism, of compromise, or even a 'third way'. Rather, new economic thinking provides something altogether different: a new way of seeing and understanding the economic world. When viewed through the eyeglasses of new economics, the old right\u2013left debates don't just look wrong, they look irrelevant. New economic thinking will not end economic or political debates; there will always be issues to argue over. But it has the promise to reframe those debates in new and hopefully more productive directions.\n\nAn economics for the real world\n\nThe term 'new economics' is both vague and broad. It is easiest to define by what it is not. New economics does not accept the orthodox theory that has dominated economics for the past several decades that humans are perfectly rational, markets are perfectly efficient, institutions are optimally designed and economies are self-correcting equilibrium systems that invariably find a state that maximises social welfare. Social scientists working in the new economics tradition argue that this theory has failed empirically on many points and that the 2008 financial crisis is only the latest and most obvious example.\n\nDefining what new economics is provides a greater challenge. As of yet there is no neatly synthesised theory to replace neoclassical orthodoxy (and some argue there never will be as the economy is too complex a system to be fully captured in a single theory). Rather new economics is best characterised as a research programme that encompasses a broad range of theories, empirical work, and methods. It is also highly interdisciplinary, involving not only economists, but psychologists, anthropologists, sociologists, historians, physicists, biologists, mathematicians, computer scientists, and others across the social and physical sciences.\n\nIt should also be emphasised that new economics is not necessarily new. Rather it builds on well-established heterodox traditions in economics such as behavioural economics, institutional economics, evolutionary economics, and studies of economic history, as well as newer streams such as complex systems studies, network theory, and experimental economics. Over the past several decades a number of Nobel prizes have been given to researchers working in what today might be called the new economics tradition, including Friedrich von Hayek, Herbert Simon, Douglass North, James Heckman, Amartya Sen, Daniel Kahneman, Thomas Schelling and Elinor Ostrom.\n\nThe common thread running through this broad research programme is a strong desire to make economic theory better reflect the empirical reality of the economy. New economics seeks explanations of how the economy works that have empirical validity. Thus behavioural economists run painstakingly crafted experiments to explain actual human economic behaviour. Institutional economists conduct detailed field investigations into the functions and dysfunctions of real institutions. Complexity theorists seek to understand the dynamic behaviour of the economy with computer models validated against data.\n\nIn my book The Origin of Wealth (2007: 97) I offered a table to summarise the contrast between traditional economics and the new economics perspective. I provide here an updated version.\n\nTraditional economists often respond that the limitations of orthodox theory are well recognised and there is much work being done to relax restrictive assumptions, introduce more realistic behaviour, heterogeneity, institutional effects, dynamics, endogenous innovation and so on. They are correct and this work is a very positive development for the field. However, much of this work introduces just one element of realism to an otherwise standard model \u2013 a bit of behaviour here, a bit of institutional realism there, and so on. It is very hard or even impossible to relax all of the assumptions at"}

However, with cumulative doses, doxorubicin also is known to have cardiotoxic effects, including cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Identification and quantification of myocardial cell damage has been a point of Controversy. We sought to identify these changes by measuring the levels of troponin I both 24 and 48 hr after the administration of doxorubicin as part of an antineoplastic treatment regimen. Thirty-eight patients scheduled to undergo treatment with doxorubicin were screened and approached for enrollment in the study. Thirty-one of them fulfilled all the inclusion criteria and also signed informed consent. All the patients enrolled in the study had blood drawn before the administration of doxorubicin and also 24 and 48 hr later. Electrocardiograms were performed prior to and 48 hr following the administration of chemotherapy. The dose of doxorubicin administered was calculated by the oncologist and ranged from 450 mg/m2-650 mg/m2 (mean 520 mg/m2). Only one patient was found to have en elevation of troponin levels both 24 and 48 hr (2.3 ng/mL and 2.1 ng/mL, respectively) after the administration of the drug. During that time, the patient denied any chest pain, shortness of breath or palpitations. Repeat ECG did not show any changes from the baseline. The remaining participants continued to maintain a troponin level of less than 0.3 ng/mL during the follow-up. In these patients, no electrocardiographic changes were noted in the follow-up ECG compared to the baseline; however, a slight drop in the ejection fraction without any impact on the clinical presentation was recorded. We concluded that the cTnl level does not change after the administration of doxorubicin, and thus cannot be used as a predictor of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity."}
{"id": 259389, "ended": true, "length": 679, "text": "Finally, an update to the very outdated mod_blog that's been available since September 3, 2009. There still isn't much documentation because, as of yet. I doubt what's here is enough but for the most dedicated to go through the code to see how this works. REQUIREMENTS If you don't meet these requirements, then you probably won't get very far. The software was written in C (don't bother asking for Perl code---there isn't any, and there won't be any) and as such, makes certain assumptions, such as: * Linux (or any POSIX compilant UNIX system) * GCC (or any C99 compiler that may come with your system) * Apache * Lua 5.1 or higher The code right now assumes you'll be running this under Apache. COMPILATION You'll need to install my CGILIB library (6.6 or higher) to compile this blog software. You can install it from https://github.com/spc476/CGILib To install it once it's downloaded, all it should take is \"make\" and then \"make install\" as root. The library assumes a POSIX environment and should compile as is on most modern Unix systems. Once that is installed, you should be able to do a \"make\" and generate the blog engine. It's built as a setuid program to avoid having a world-writable directory, but if that is a concern, you can certain remove the setuid'ness of it, but make sure the data directories are writable by Apache. INSTALLATION The assumption on the blog engine is that the executable resides in a directory visible to Apache and runnable from within Apache's docroot for the the site in question. I have my copy named as \"boston.cgi\" and Apache configured to execute such programs via CGI. The htdocs/ subdirectory contains a sample website to run the blog. There's also a sample htaccess file that shows the method I use to run the blog engine. In the journal/ subdirectory is out-of-band files (which should not be served up by Apache). There you will find a sample configuration file and a sample entry to see how the data is stored (each entry is a separate file, stored under a Year/Month/Day directory structure). And yes, there is code to do email notifications, but it's not enabled by default. I only left the code in to support the half dozen people that did sign up to receive email notifications. The HTML entry form works, but it's not my primary method for new entries---for that, I use email. I have the following line in '/etc/aliases': myjournal: \"/path/to/boston.cgi --config /path/to/config --email --cmd new\" To make an entry, I format an email to the journal address as: +-----[top of file]---------------------------- |author: [who you set at author---exact match] |title: [title of entry] |class: [keywords] |status: [status repeated on Facebook] |adtag: [keyword used for advertising network] | |body of entry, usually including HTML | ... +---------------------------------------------- And that's pretty much it.

And I assumed he was born in this country. But six weeks ago, I started really looking into it. He's got a certificate of live birth. That's by the way, despite what certain liberal press says, that's not a birth certificate. It is a big, big step lower. In fact, in some places, you can get married or get a driver's license with a certificate of live birth, OK?

You have to see this thing. It's like a certificate of live birth is not appropriate.\n\nNow, I say to myself, why? A few -- just simple questions, why doesn't he show his birth certificate, number one. You know, they say it is sealed. Well, but for the person, you could release it. And if it's the person, you could -- sure, it's sealed, it should be sealed, that's great.\n\nBut the person, you know, I actually sent to New York for my birth certificate. And they actually got on the phone, they said Mr. Trump, I'm sorry to do this sir, you have to give me your Social Security number. You have to prove, it's really you I'm talking to. I went through a whole big thing. OK, but when they figured out it was actually me, they sent it to me. I had to pay $38, and they sent me my birth certificate. They could do the same thing to him, and I say, why did he spent millions of dollars on trying to stay away from this issue? Why doesn't he give his birth certificate?\n\nHANNITY: The one thing on his side is that they have these announcements in the newspaper, eight days after.\n\nTRUMP: Eight days later.\n\nHANNITY: Yes.\n\nTRUMP: It was eight days. Look, he's got a grandmother in Kenya who said he was born in Kenya at the hospital. Then there was bedlam in the room, bedlam. I don't mean like a little, you know, because he was close to becoming president. And there were a lot of people in that room, and he was being, she was talking to a reporter with a lot of handlers. A lot of Obama handlers. So, they had the grandmother, she said Kenya. Then all of a sudden, 51 seconds later, he asked the question again. And you hear people scream, no, no Hawaii, Hawaii! OK? Give me a break. Now, the other one was eight or nine days later from the reported birth date. But you don't know if it was even the reported. But they could have easily come from Kenya or someplace.\n\nHANNITY: The issue would go away in a minute. Just show the certificate.\n\nTRUMP: I don't understand. Why he doesn't show?

The two sides began discussions following Canelo's sixth round knockout of Amir Khan. Last week, Canelo made a decision to vacate the WBC title and the sanctioning body named Golovkin as their new beltholder.\n\nLoeffler believes Mayweather is against the Canelo-GGG pay-per-view, because of the action in that contest would outshine Mayweather's 'Fight of The Century' with Manny Pacquiao last May. The Mayweather-Pacquiao PPV was ripped apart by fans who opened their wallets and saw little to no fireworks.\n\n\"He doesn't want to see Canelo fight 'GGG' because it would be a completely different situation than his fight with Manny,\" Loeffler stated to the LA Times.\n\n\"It [would] give the fans what they want [with] two warriors [who] actually fought in the ring instead of dancing to a 12-round decision. That's not how 'GGG' is built and he wants to give fans their money's worth instead of taking their money for boring decisions.\""}

Parrot's dbus service capabilities offer signals and methods that allow you to remotely set up watches to back up files and/or signal on events.\n\nParrot is a systemd user service, being so means that the DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS will not be set to the correct bus address (since none of the environment variables are set in a systemd user instance). To circumvent this, Parrot runs an instance of dbus as a systemd service. There are several files under the systemd directory to set this up. The .socket unit activates the systemd socket for the dbus bus address. The matching .service unit executes the dbus session, while the .conf drop in sets the environment variable bus address name.\n\nThe screenshot above shows an instance of Parrot on d-feet (a dbus utility program). Once a Parrot watch is set on a directory, anytime a file in that directory is opened Parrot will make a backup of that file before any changes occur. That way if any mistakes are written to that file and saved, there will be a backup of the file before those changes took place.\n\nIn addition to backing up files, Parrot functions in helping log when those changes/accesses in the Parrot'd directory occur. By subscribing to Parrot's accessed signal, Parrot will broadcast a signal in the form of seconds since the epoch whenever a file in the watch directory is accessed.

{"id": 259410, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Submitted by Michael Snyder via The End of The American Dream blog,\n\nFor the first time in decades, it feels like morning in America again. I was quite young when Ronald Reagan was president, and I only have vague memories from those days. But I do remember the extraordinary optimism that his leadership inspired, and my hope is that Donald Trump's leadership will be just as inspirational. For such a very long time, it has seemed as though a giant dark cloud has been hanging over America, but now a new day is starting. If Donald Trump can be president of the United States, it seems like just about anything can be possible. And even though our nation is facing incredibly serious challenges, could it be possible that we can find a way to turn things around if we all work together?\n\nSeeing Trump on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on Thursday was a very special moment. Like Lincoln, Trump represents a once in a generation hope for real change\u2026\n\nKicking off three days of carefully orchestrated inaugural proceedings infused with pomp and guided by precision and protocol, the president-elect reveled in the moment and delivered a tribute to the populist movement that propelled him into office. \"We all got tired of seeing what was happening and we wanted change, but we wanted real change,\" Trump said on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. \"It's a movement like we've never seen anywhere in the world, they say.\"\n\nInaugurations are a time for hope, and tens of millions of us are hoping that the election of Trump will mean a better future for all of us.\n\nBut of course so many among the elite hate him with a passion, and there are many in both parties that will be fighting him every step of the way.\n\nCan Trump really be successful in such an environment?\n\nWe shall see, but what seems clear is that he doesn't plan to change who he is now that he will be residing in the White House, and this is clearly rankling a lot of people\u2026\n\nDonald Trump enters the White House on Friday just as he entered the race for president: defiant, unfiltered, unbound by tradition and utterly confident in his chosen course. In the 10 weeks since his surprise election as the nation's 45th president, Trump has violated decades of established diplomatic protocol, sent shockwaves through business boardrooms, tested long-standing ethics rules and continued his combative style of replying to any slight with a personal attack \u2014 on Twitter and in person.\n\nIn his inaugural address, Trump will plead for national unity, and that is a good thing because our nation is deeply divided right now. As a new Rasmussen survey has discovered, most of the country has a very strong opinion about him either one way or the other\u2026\n\nThe latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone and online survey finds that 52% of Likely U.S. Voters share a favorable opinion of Trump, with 30% who have a Very Favorable one. The president-elect is viewed unfavorably by 48%, including 37% with a Very Unfavorable view.\n\nBut the good news is that Americans are feeling quite good about life overall these days. In fact, an astounding 80 percent of all Americans are content with \"the overall quality of life\" that they are enjoying at the moment\u2026\n\nAmericans are feeling far more upbeat this January than they were a year ago, especially about the economy, according to Gallup's annual \"Mood of the Nation\" poll, which is conducted each January. The most recent poll, conducted Jan. 4-8, finds a whopping 80 percent of Americans are satisfied with \"the overall quality of life,\" up four points from a year ago.\n\nIf Donald Trump can bring the nation together, perhaps the next four (or eight) years can be a time of renewal for America.\n\nAn immense amount of damage was done during the Obama years, and Trump has a massive amount of work ahead of him. But he seems to have a boundless amount of energy, and he is accustomed to only sleeping a handful of hours a night.\n\nLet us pray that Trump and his team will make good decisions and will set this nation on the right course, because we are in desperate need of a turnaround.\n\nEarlier today, I came across a piece from an anonymous source that is entitled \"Twas The Night Before Inauguration\". The anonymous source indicated that it was okay to share this with others, and so I thought that I would share it with all of you\u2026\n\nTwas the night before Inauguration, and up in the tower,\n\nThe Donald reflected on his newfound power.\n\nThe conservative masses had come out in force,\n\nAnd delivered a victory that would chart a new course.\n\nThe snowflakes were shell-shocked with tears in their eyes,\n\nThe media lied to them . . . What a surprise.\n\nThey had been promised a Hillary win,\n\nBut the criminal Clinton took one"}

The much-anticipated announcement brings the agency one step closer to fulfilling a key pillar of President Obama's sweeping climate plan \u2014 cutting carbon pollution from both new and existing power plants.\n\nSpeaking before reporters at the National Press Club, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy touted the agency's plan as \"one of the most significant actions we can take\" to protect public health and the environment from the dangers of climate change. \"By taking commonsense action to limit carbon pollution from new power plants we can slow the effects of climate change and fulfill our obligation to ensure a safe and healthy environment for our children,\" McCarthy said.\n\nNoting the \"really long lifetimes\" of power plants, McCarthy explained that \"people are making decisions about these plants today, and that is why we need to act today.\" The standards, the administrator added, would \"ensure a clear path forward for a full energy mix.\"\n\nUnder the proposal, the EPA would require one standard for large natural gas plants, allowing an emissions rate of 1,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt hour of power generated. Another, slightly less restrictive standard would apply to coal-fired facilities, allowing a carbon dioxide emissions rate of 1,100 lbs. per megawatt hour.\n\nEPA air officials say a modern gas plant could meet the standard but not its coal counterpart. Under the plan, the agency would require future coal plants to install equipment for capturing and storing carbon pollution on a partial scale, which officials call \"a simpler, less costly way to reduce carbon emissions.\"\n\nAgency officials present their proposal as \"both flexible and achievable.\" They point to the construction of four coal plants that will feature carbon capture and storage technology as proof that this equipment is available and ready for use. As with most technologies, they say, the cost will likely become more affordable over time.\n\nThe proposed rule essentially mirrors emissions standards that the EPA put forth in March 2012, setting off a fierce lobbying frenzy among coal companies and coal-burning utilities opposed to what they consider to be an effective ban on coal plants. Opponents say this latest proposal would have pretty much the same effect.\n\n\"We don't believe there will be any new coal plants because of this rule,\" Paul Bailey, of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, the coal industry's most public voice, said Friday. \"We think this rule is really bad for coal plants and it's really bad for carbon capture and storage, too.\"\n\n-------------------------\n\nDon't miss a single Center for Public Integrity investigation on the environment.\n\nSign up now to receive special newsletters relevant to your interest.\n\n-------------------------\n\nSuch technology, coal advocates say, has yet to be commercially proven. They note that none of the four coal plants EPA officials cite are operating \u2014 two are under construction and two are under development. For the most part, they argue, these are government-funded demonstration projects whose conditions cannot be replicated at coal plants across the country.\n\n\"Until a few months ago, no one would have believed that the EPA would have claimed that carbon capture was demonstrated technology,\" said Jeffrey Holmstead, who represents coal and utility companies at the D.C. lobbying firm Bracewell & Guiliani.\n\nCalling the new EPA plan \"surprisingly aggressive,\" he noted that the agency's 2012 proposal declined to make such a claim. He predicted the coal and utility industries will fight the agency's reliance on nascent technology as a basis for an emissions standard.\n\n\"There will certainly be a big debate over this,\" added Holmstead, who headed the EPA's air office under President George W. Bush. \"If EPA says, 'This is the standard,' there will be litigation.\"\n\nIn a statement, Trip Van Noppen, president of the environmental law firm Earthjustice, called the EPA proposal \"welcome news. Tackling carbon pollution from power plants is critical to addressing the climate crisis that we now face.\"\n\nThe EPA proposal must go through a 60-day public comment period, and the agency plans to hold a public hearing."}
{"id": 259413, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Entrapment is a defense to criminal charges. It prohibits a conviction when the defendant can show that he had no original intent to commit a crime, and did so only because law enforcement agents persuaded or coerced him. Law enforcement can provide opportunities for suspected criminals to commit crimes (through undercover operations or stings, for example) and then charge the offender, but police cannot \"manufacture crime.\"\n\nAffirmative Defense\n\nEntrapment is an affirmative defense, which means the defendant has the burden of proving that entrapment occurred. The defendant must prove that:\n\nlaw enforcement agents approached the defendant and/or introduced the idea of committing a crime\n\nthe defendant was not \"ready and willing\" to commit the crime, and\n\nlaw enforcement agents did more than just provide an opportunity to the defendant -- they actually persuaded or coerced the defendant to commit the crime, possibly by improper conduct.\n\nFor more information about affirmative defenses, see Affirmative Defenses in Criminal Cases.\n\nObjective v. Subjective Standard\n\nIn order to prove an entrapment defense, the defendant must provide evidence that satisfies either an objective or a subjective standard, depending on the law in the state where the defendant is charged.\n\nObjective standard\n\nUnder an objective standard, the defendant must prove that the actions of law enforcement would have induced any law-abiding citizen to commit a crime. The focus under this standard is more on the actions of law enforcement and less on the defendant's predisposition to commit crime.\n\nSubjective standard\n\nUnder a subjective standard, the defendant must prove that he did not have a pre-disposition to commit the crime, regardless of the actions of the police. Even if a police officer's actions were extreme and inappropriate, the jury or judge deciding an entrapment case under this standard must consider whether the defendant was predisposed to commit the crime and whether that motivated the defendant more than police actions.\n\nBurden of proof\n\nUnder the objective standard, if the defendant can prove entrapment by a preponderance of the evidence (this is a less strict requirement than reasonable doubt), the judge or jury must find him not guilty. Under the subjective standard, the defendant is not entitled to a not guilty verdict. Instead, the judge or jury must also consider whether the prosecution has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime because of his criminal predisposition and not because of police actions (even if the actions were overly persuasive).\n\nWhat Is and Is Not Entrapment\n\nWhether the actions of the police qualify as entrapment will depend heavily on the facts of any given situation, as well as the standard (objective or subjective) that is used in the case. Here are some scenarios that suggest a finding of entrapment--or not.\n\nEntrapment\n\nSuppose the police threaten to gravely injure an average, law-abiding citizen unless he delivers a package of drugs to another person, collects payment, and brings the money back to the police. The police have entrapped the person because he had no predisposition or intent to engage in criminal activity and did so only under duress. This is a very simple example of entrapment, which also satisfies either the objective or the subjective standard because:\n\nobjective standard: the police conduct (threatening physical harm) was so extreme, or\n\nsubjective standard: the defendant had no interest in or intent to commit any crime.\n\nFor another example of entrapment, under either an objective or subjective standard, imagine a homeless man who is a petty criminal and drug addict with prior convictions for possession of small amounts of drugs and minor theft. The police suspect that he sometimes sells drugs for a local drug king pin but it is only a hunch. An undercover officer contacts the man on the street and offers him money to pick up and deliver a shipment of drugs (a pound of meth) coming into town on an Amtrak train. (The shipment is not real. It has been created by police.) The man tells the undercover officer that he only uses and does not get involved in drug trafficking. The undercover officer approaches the man every other day for over a week, buys him meals, and tries to talk him into the deal. The man refuses again and again but is finally worn down with offers of the money plus an ounce of the drug and a hotel room for a week -- all of this on a day when he is out of drugs and desperate to get high.\n\nThis scenario would constitute entrapment because:\n\nobjective standard: the police provided everything for the criminal process and preyed on the man's vulnerabilities to persuade him to commit the crime instead of accepting the answer, \"No,\" or\n\nsubjective standard: the man was not interested in being involved in drug trafficking (the police could not prove that he had a predisposition to commit the crime of drug trafficking).\n\nNot entrapment\n\nHere is an example"}

I (Mark Crowther) think the book is wonderful and have learned a lot from it. I'm not sure I agree it is for players of all strengths, I think a certain amount of ability is needed to get something out of it. As someone who has struggled with quite a lot of instructional literature over the years this book is a great tonic. I've found strong practical puzzle books as the only thing I've truly got on with. This book has given me many ideas on what to try next. I was pleased to read in the book there is a nice idea on how to use the TWIC games section by choosing random games and positions to produce an almost unlimited amount of exercise material. See John Watson's detailed review below.\n\nJohn Watson Book Review #103 - Challenging Conventional Wisdom\n\nMove First, Think Later; Willy Hendriks; 256 pages; New in Chess 2012\n\nIntroduction\n\nI've been asked about Willy Hendriks' Move First, Think Later enough times (by people who loved or disliked it) that I thought I'd contribute my own two cents worth. This review turned into something frighteningly long, but that's in large part due to the fact that I have reproduced Hendriks' examples and prose at considerable length to give you a direct taste of the material.\n\nFirst, let me attempt a general description of the book, which, incidentally, won the English Chess Federation's 2012 Book of the Year award. In Move First, Think Later (subtitled ' Sense and Nonsense in Improving Your Chess'), Hendriks tries to demolish a number of myths (in his view) about how to improve one's chess, as well as to investigate how the mind of a chessplayer works and what insights can be derived therefrom. In doing so, he refers to the cognitive sciences (\"cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, neurology, neurobiology, philosophy and others\"), which he says have made \"considerable progress.\" To quote from the Introduction: \"From general concepts and theories we are moving towards knowledge on a more empirical and microscopic level, to summarise it briefly and (too) simply. Some of the old questions and new insights of the cognitive sciences form the source of inspiration for this book. Are they of any use for the player trying to improve his chess? Do they shed new light on our different training methods? Or even suggest new and different forms of training?\" But what most people will remember from this book, and will likely be either amused or alarmed by, is Hendriks' acidic criticism of famous chess authors and of conventional chess wisdom. Much more on that below.\n\nThe book consists of 27 chapters, most of which are essentially essays covering a wide array of subjects. It has quite a few exercises, presented at the beginning of each chapter and then discussed within the chapter, which I think is an attractive and useful method of getting your points across. Hendriks' says, with his usual sense of humour: \"If you do the exercises, you will learn the most from this book. Some may say: 'You will learn at least something.' \"\n\nThe range of topics is impressive - Hendriks likes to jump here and there, touching upon subjects or random thoughts which are only tangentially related to chess. That's fine, even stimulating, and particularly good for browsing. In part, this flitting about may be due to the fact that some of the chapters were originally articles written for a chess column. Nevertheless, a good portion of the book's contents are related to a major unifying idea. That is expressed in various ways in various chapters, but to a large extent comes down to the idea that moves themselves are more important than verbal concepts in chess, and that methods for improvement that go from the general to the particular are flawed. He has several ways of saying this, e.g., \"You learn to play good chess by taking in good chess. There is no way to outsmart a diligent student with some clever way of thinking. There is no short-cut route to the best move by some revolutionary way of looking at the position. The strongest players are not following secret protocols.\"\n\nHendriks Video Lecture from London Classic\n\nAnother version of this can be seen in a lecture by Hendriks at the London Chess Classic, which you can see on YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=7CWvB5pz79k).\n\nImprove without using language?\n\nIn it he says \"In my book I have the suggestion that maybe it's possible to improve your chess"}

{"id": 259418, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "I recently had the pleasure of reading Alexander Germain's article on League of Legends, about the insights the competitive game gave him on human behaviour. Now I don't play LOL but I used to devote a fair whack of time to Dota2 an extremely similar game (I think the correct term is MOBA but I am getting on in my lingo these days) and promised Alexander to share my thoughts on why these games show so much toxicity especially between team-mates.\n\nNow for any newbies out there it may be useful to explain some parts of the game to put some context to my theories\n\nThe first point of Dota is that you are placed in a team of 5 heroes placed against another 5 in the opposing team. In order to win, by destroying the enemy's ancient, you typically have to not only perform well on your own but also co-operate well with the other 4 comrades on your side. I will drip feed game basics as I go hopefully in a way that makes sense without just turning this post into a lengthy description of game mechanics.\n\nSomething that seems to set MOBA's apart from other online games is the level of toxicity, bad-mouthing and general ill feeling between players. While I'm not saying they are definitively the worst (because that is a rather huge statement to make regarding online gaming) but in mine and many other's experience the shade can get pretty dark, and what I want to talk about is the odd fact that much of the abuse seems to happen between team member. I say this is odd because social psychology would usually predict animosity between groups put into competition with each other, especially when in a co-operative situation with direct communication between team members, and less between teams.\n\nDon't get me wrong there is plenty of trash talk between teams \u2013 also its worth noting that hating is not 100% common, but certainly frequent enough to ruin a good evening.\n\nSo why is there hate between squaddies? (and what relevance does it have to anyone who doesn't play?) Well to address the latter I believe that the game does actually provide some tips to providing insight into people's real behaviour, especially in say politics, workplaces and even families.\n\nNow to the former\n\nKey Point: there is actually more competition between your own team than the enemy\n\nThis is where I need to explain some more game mechanics. There are a range of heroes to choose from, and only one of each hero can be in the game each time. Now this might seem a petty reason to hate, but one of the first conflicts is choosing a hero. Now obviously an opposing team member might choose a hero you want, but your own team-mates choice effects you more directly. To add another point each hero has a particular role, I don't want to bore with too much detail, but as a general rule people are attracted to 'Carrys' which are characters which become very strong later in the game (and are thus very satisfying to play) and tend to avoid playing 'Support' which are characters which are good for supporting other teammates and helping said carry's git gud.\n\nIts this role choice which probably causes more conflict than any specific hero (although that does happen) the core problem is, people have their own personal playing needs, i.e., to get super powerful and look like a bad-ass in game and don't prioritize building a balanced team over their individual wants.\n\nI say this is relevant to real life because this kind of prioritizing can be seen all the time: spouses want to win arguments more than maintain relationships, workers want to be seen positively as an individual more than meet the companies goals, politicians fight for power rather than to run their countries.\n\nThe other interesting thing about competition is that the game actually puts your team in a position where you are competing more against each other for limited resources, than the enemy. It's a weird system to explain but the basic principle is that for every enemy you kill the loot and bonus' is divided between nearby allies, hence solo kills = all the more resources, and sharing means less. What's interesting about this again is that while technically you are 5 teammates being thrown against an enemy, your real focus is getting more gold and experience and the main people holding you back are your own team.\n\nSo to summarize that point \u2013 people in competition with each other are more likely to dehumanize and demonize each other. Even if there is some overarching goal, people respond to immediate pressures.\n\nA second point is something psychologists like to call the fundamental attribution error, which in a nutshell means that you attribute other's mistakes to their loser personality, and your own to the unfair circumstances around you. So when Dota players see their team mate get trounced or make a bad play they assume the worst, when they themselves slip up, 'IMBA, WTF potato team?, I'm tilting today'\n\nFinally I suspect there is an intolerance against lack of control in a"}
{"id": 259419, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "PSA: The following features spoilers for Life is Strange and Season One of Telltale's The Walking Dead.\n\nDONTNOD entertainment announced today that they've been working on a sequel to Life is Strange, in a YouTube video rich with beautiful French accents and unspoken sexual tension.\n\nNo other details have been confirmed, so only a giant, entitled manchild who overthinks every little thing about Life is Strange could possibly have any demands to make at this stage.\n\nSo.\n\nLeave Max and Chloe behind, you beautiful French bastards.\n\nThe strengths of the original season of Life is Strange centre around the relationship between Max and Chloe. Whilst ostensibly a sci-fi mystery, the game's highest points came from the quieter moments between the two. It was feeling of spending time with Max and Chloe that kept fans coming back for each episode, far more than the underlying mystery of Rachel Amber.\n\nGiven the sometimes unsettling fondness fans have for \"Pricefield\", leaving this chemistry behind may seem like a gamble \u2013 But it's essential for a second season to succeed on its own merits.\n\n#1 \u2013 The Multiple Endings.\n\nContinuing Max and Chloe's story has some logistical concerns. Of the two endings available in the first season's final episode, Chloe is either dead, or Max and Chloe are murderous, bloodthirsty psychopaths.\n\nThe choice to spare Chloe by sacrificing Arcadia Bay (and everyone in it) was baffling at the time \u2013 As players watched the two romantically drive past the rotting corpses of their friends and family, presumably to have crazy hotel sex in the next town. Now, with the prospect of a sequel, DONTNOD have written themselves into a corner here. Do they choose a \"canon\" ending, and let the other fall into non-canonical oblivion? There's certainly a story to be told with Max learning to come to terms with the death of Chloe, perhaps time travelling to visit her in the past as she struggles to let go \u2013 but what of the animals who chose to murder her parents? DONTNOD wrote an ending chosen entirely by amoral psychopaths, and now risk angering the horde by taking away the deaths of their victims. Look at that video. Look at those beautiful boys. Can you bear to put them in such danger?\n\n#2 \u2013 Repeating the mistakes of the past.\n\nLife is Strange could encounter the same problems Telltale's The Walking Dead did in its second and third seasons. Due to its choice-based, episodic format, Life is Strange attracted immediate comparisons to Telltale's work \u2013 and it risks making the same mistakes. Telltale's first season the The Walking Dead was hugely popular for the same reason Life is Strange proved successful: The relationship between its two leads, Lee and Clementine.\n\nThe final episode's emotional farewell proved to be the perfect finale \u2013 Much to the detriment of the following seasons. The death of the player-insert character Lee, leaving Clementine alone in an uncertain world perfectly fit thematically with the game at large. For five episodes, the player has been teaching Clementine the tools she needs to survive in the world, post-zombie apocalypse. At its finale, the player leaves Clementine just as Lee does: Hoping it was enough. Until season two, when we see that she's totally fine, anyway. Despite being a solid experience with a great new cast, the game's second season never proved as popular as the original, and the third season has attracted even less attention. For many players, saying goodbye to Clementine the first time was enough.\n\nLife is Strange fans may feel the same. One way or another, we've said goodbye to Max and Chloe. Either we've seen Chloe accept her death, or we've imagined the pair making love over the corpses of their loved ones. Either way, revisiting them is going to feel awkward.\n\n#3 \u2013 An opportunity to get me to shut the fuck up.\n\nThis is DONTNOD's opportunity to prove that season one wasn't lightning in a bottle. Life is Strange is by far their most successful title, after their previous game Remember Me released to mixed reviews. Upcoming title Vampyr seems promising, though a return to a combat-centred game is something of a step away from the peaceful life of Arcadia Bay. Despite this, I've explained before that I feel that perhaps many of the first season's successes were a happy accident.\n\nIn introducing a new cast, DONTNOD have the opportunity to prove they have the narrative chops to compete with Telltale \u2013 with the added bonus of making me look like a tool. Which I've been told is very satisfying.\n\nWith a second season DONTNOD could become the American Horror Story of video games. By keeping an alternative, young adult aesthetic mixed with sci-fi themes \u2013 but recycling the cast each time*, Life is Strange could become a series that outlives the duo who"}

Lessons have been learned, albeit they were rather expensive ones for some people.\n\nThe DAO Is Done For But The Concept Is Not\n\nIt has become apparent The DAO \u2013 which is the world's largest crowdfunding campaign to date \u2013 is pretty much done for. Not only did assailants manage to abuse the code several times, but there is also a negative aftermath to deal with. Coinmarketcap has removed DAO tokens from their listings, and Poloniex advises users to exchange DAO for Ethereum.\n\nThere are a lot of valuable lessons to be learned from this US$150m screw-up, though. First of all, the crowdfunding campaign was a big success, but the creators also allowed investors to pull their funds back out if they had second thoughts. Some of them did, whereas others kept the faith in the concept.\n\nNow that users can exchange their DAO tokens for Ethereum once again, most people will have lost little to no funds. It is sad to see this big future for cryptocurrency projects fail in the end, but the DAO concept is still very much alive today. Hopefully, we will not see another mega project such as The DAO V2 run by the same Slock.it team, though.\n\nGranted, the failed project puts a spin on how useful a decentralized autonomous organization can be. Many people seem to forget this innovative technology is way ahead of its time, and there will be many kinks that need to be worked out along the way. That doesn't mean the entire concept is dead in the water all of a sudden, though, as a decentralized autonomous organization is still a viable future.\n\nThe biggest gripe people have right now is the Slock.it team themselves. Not only did they raise US$150m for a project they knew as flawed from day one, they are also tightly related to the Robin Hood Group. These self-professed white-hat hackers have been involved in retrieving Ethereum funds stolen from the DAO, as well as the ETC funds obtained in the process. However, they tried to dump the Ethereum Classic coins a few days ago, and were caught red-handed.

There is something particularly sexist, I'd say abusive, about this recording.\n\nRead this excerpt:\n\n\"When you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\"\n\n\"Whatever you want,\" the interviewer says.\n\n\"Grab 'em by the pussy, you can do anything,\" Trump replies.\"\n\nIt's the way Mr Trump reveals that he sees women as a piece of sexual meat, something he wants, grabs, discards that is so damning.\n\nSurveys (US government and UN) suggest one in five American women are the victim of rape or attempted rape and a staggering 83% of girls suffer sexual harassment at school.\n\nMr Trump is not guilty of either of those but his language is exactly the kind of language that encourages men and boys to feel it's okay to abuse women.\n\nThere is a violence in the phrases \"grab 'em by the pussy\" and \"you can do anything\" that any victim of abuse would recognise and that most women would find sickening.\n\nTo dismiss the tape as mere \"locker room banter\" and imply that the people who are offended are making an unnecessary fuss, or to say, as he did in his bizarre overnight apology tape, that this is just a distraction, compounds his problem.\n\nImage copyright European photopress agency Image caption Trump has offended many groups of people before\n\nBut this tape doesn't just offend women, judging from the reaction in the Republican party - it has offended a lot of men too. Whether those men will now withdraw their endorsements of him is yet to be seen.\n\nMr Trump has denigrated people before. His comments about Muslims and Mexicans have arguably been equally grotesque and many, including some Republicans, have suggested they disqualified him for the presidency too.\n\nNot everyone in America, however, knows a Muslim or a Mexican. Most people, and most voters, do have wives, mothers, sisters or daughters and that's why this tape touches a nerve, with both sexes, in a way his previous remarks haven't.\n\nPowerful men using their position to get sex is nothing new, even in the White House. JFK and Bill Clinton paved that path.\n\nToday some of Trump's supporters are making the case that anyone who voted for Bill Clinton has no right to be offended by Donald Trump.\n\nImage copyright AP Image caption Will the subject of Bill Clinton's infidelities now come up at Sunday's debate?\n\nI've been critical of Mr Clinton's treatment of women, and of Mrs Clinton's role in shielding him, but those supporters are missing the point.\n\nIn 2016, don't we all want more from our leaders than another man who feels getting sex from whoever they want, whenever they want is simply one of the perks of power? For my two daughters, I know I do.\n\nHow Mr Trump manages the fallout from this isn't clear. He doesn't like apologising. Indeed, he has bragged about never doing so.\n\nYet overnight he did release a video statement in which he said: \"I said it, I was wrong, and I apologise.\"\n\nIn the tape he then goes on to attack both Clintons' records. So on Sunday night, when he debates with Hillary Clinton for the second time, will he raise the issue of Bill Clinton's affairs and Hillary's role in discrediting the women involved, or will he keep quiet about sex altogether?\n\nIn the past Mr Trump has not been able to resist lashing out when he's under attack. So, whatever his advisers may caution, I suspect we will see more of that in St Louis on Sunday night."}

But an Army report issued this year found that violent felonies in the service were up 1% while non-violent felonies increased 11% between 2010 and 2011.During that time, however, crime in much of the nation declined.\"What we're seeing is that the volume (of violent incidents involving military personnel off base) has ratcheted up to a level we have never seen before,\" Cusick said.Much of the anecdotal evidence reads like the report of the Jan. 13 standoff between Army Staff Sgt. Joshua Eisenhauer, 30, a veteran of multiple combat tours, and Fayetteville, N.C., police and firefighters.A 911 call from an apartment complex manager revealed that Eisenhauer was allegedly barricaded inside one of the apartments exchanging gunfire with police.Although the suspect was not specifically identified as a soldier, the apartment manager told a police dispatcher that the suspect was \"under psychiatric care,\" according to the 911 call.According to Fort Bragg records, Eisenhauer had been assigned to the post's Warrior Transition Battalion, a unit for soldiers who have been wounded or suffered other illnesses as a result of their deployment, Womack Army Medical Center spokeswoman Shannon Lynch said.Eisenhauer, who was wounded in the standoff along with two police officers, is charged with 30 criminal counts, including 15 counts of attempted murder.Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities (Police) Chiefs Association, said the type of training proposed by the Justice Department represents \"one piece of the challenge'' in dealing with an increasing number of mentally ill suspects.\"This has been a challenge for a number of years in our communities,\" Stephens said.Source: USA Today"}
{"id": 259433, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "When approaching a band's debut album, one should of course bear in mind the sage advice of George Michael and Listen Without Prejudice. Nevertheless the very facts of the making of Atoms for Peace's Amok seem designed to send a certain kind of music fan screaming from the room without hearing a note. It is, by any definition, the work of a supergroup: as well as Thom Yorke and long-term producer Nigel Godrich, it features Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, \"guest percussionist\" Mauro Refosco and REM's Joey Waronker. Amok resulted from their gathering together to indulge in \"freeform\" sessions in Los Angeles, having apparently bonded over a shared love of \"getting wasted \u2026 and listening to Fela Kuti\". Rich and famous musicians jamming in LA after getting high and kicking back with some funky ethnic sounds: it's hard to get away from the feeling that this is just the kind of thing that once provoked people to form the Cockney Rejects in protest. It is, to borrow a phrase sighingly deployed in Smash Hits with some regularity, like punk never 'appened.\n\nAnyone who understandably finds their inner Stinky Turner rising up in indignation at all this is not much likely to be mollified by Godrich's comparison of Atoms for Peace's working techniques to fusion-era Miles Davis, rock stars equating themselves with jazz greats coming just beneath rock stars equating themselves with classical composers in the list of stuff that made a generation less tolerant than our own break out the safety pins and gobbing. In fairness, the method to which Godrich is referring genuinely isn't far removed from that used by Davis and producer Teo Macero from In a Silent Way onwards: he and Yorke filleted sections of the band's lengthy jams, edited them together, then weaved the results into electronic arrangements. You can hear this at its most straightforward on opener Before Your Very Eyes. It starts out sounding just as you'd expect an afrobeat-influenced track by Thom Yorke featuring Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers to sound: pattering drums, scratchy guitar, bassline that is, to all intents and purposes, jumping around with its top off, and Chuckles himself keening away about nameless dread. But each instrument is gradually replaced by an electronic counterpart, until, by the song's end, only Yorke's voice remains untouched: the scenery around it has completely changed.\n\nElsewhere, the interlacing of instruments and electronics is so fluid it's hard to work out where the band ends and the computer begins. The traditional supergroup works on the principle that great music is born out of each member's inflated sense of their own importance chafing against everyone else's\u2013 as a 1974 feature in Time magazine put it, they are \"fuelled by dueling egos\" and \"musical infighting builds up the excitement\" \u2013 but the music here appears to flip that logic on its head: no member is as important as a laptop. You listen to something like Reverse Running, on which a rhythm track bearing the audible influence of 2-step garage is so intricately entwined with Waronker and Refoscos' percussion that it sounds as if it's been put together using a pair of tweezers, wondering at precisely how Atoms for Peace \u2013 formed, lest we forget, for the specific purpose of playing Yorke's solo material live \u2013 are going to play it live.\n\nAs a technical exercise, Amok is hugely impressive: in contrast to Yorke's undercooked solo album, The Eraser, its sound is rich and deep, full of intriguing shifts and contrasts. But there are times when it feels the painstaking process used to create it may have assumed a greater importance than the business of actually writing songs. Default has a great central motif, but the song it's attached to drifts by without leaving much impression. Something similar happens on Stuck Together Pieces. You could happily listen to its gorgeous descending bassline all day, which is perhaps just as well, given that what's going on over the top of it feels pretty slender and sketchy. In a recent interview, Godrich made a passing remark about Yorke really wanting to make a straightforward dance record but feeling that, \"I have to sing on it or no one's going to fucking care\". It was meant as a joke, but occasionally during Amok you wonder not only if there's a grain of truth in it, but whether Yorke might not have been better off acting on the impulse.\n\nStill, when Amok works, the results are spectacular. Ingenue's warping, off-key analogue synth and dripping-water sound effects would make a great dance track in their own right, but the vocal melody they're matched to is as sublime as anything Yorke's ever come up with. The closing title track is simultaneously writhingly funky and strangely haunting:"}

He would also seek to change the labor law in the coming legislative session, which begins in January, to prevent future governors from using executive powers to roll back the wages. Mr. Cuomo will be up for re-election in 2018, at the end of which the $15 rate will be put into effect in New York City.\n\nThe job categories affected by the plan include lifeguards, office assistants and custodial staff, some of which are seasonal. Wages in New York City would be raised first, administration officials said, because of its higher cost of living.\n\nThe notion of a statewide $15 minimum wage for all employees, public and private, has faced resistance from Republicans in Albany, and some conservative fiscal groups, who warn it would be disastrous for the state's economy and job growth. On Tuesday, Senator John J. Flanagan of Long Island, the Republican leader in the State Senate, had no comment on the governor's decision.\n\nMr. Cuomo's announcement was met with an enthusiastic response from labor leaders like George Gresham, the president of 1199 S.E.I.U., the nation's largest health care workers union, who applauded the governor's action. Mr. Gresham said it could potentially set a $15-an-hour standard of pay for tens of thousands of the union's home-care workers, \"who do this important work, but who are not necessarily state employees.\"\n\nThe announcement prompted the city's public advocate, Letitia A. James, to call for a $15 minimum wage for city employees. A spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio, a fellow Democrat and frequent sparring partner of Mr. Cuomo's, noted that the city had already promised its lowest paid workers more than $12 an hour in 2016, while the governor's plan would accelerate past that level only at the end of 2017."}

Among the subunits common to Arabidopsis thaliana Pols II, IV, and V are 93% identical alternative ninth subunits, NRP(B/D/E)9a and NRP(B/D/E)9b. The 9a and 9b subunit variants are incompletely redundant with respect to Pol II; whereas double mutants are embryo lethal, single mutants are viable, yet phenotypically distinct. Likewise, 9a or 9b can associate with Pols IV or V but RNA-directed DNA methylation is impaired only in 9b mutants. Based on genetic and molecular tests, we attribute the defect in RdDM to impaired Pol V function. Collectively, our results reveal a role for the ninth subunit in RNA silencing and demonstrate that subunit diversity generates functionally distinct subtypes of RNA polymerases II and V.\n\nUnlike yeast and metazoans, Arabidopsis thaliana and Populus trichocarpa (poplar) each have two genes orthologous to RBP9, and maize and rice have three ( Figure 1 and Figure S1 ). Orthologs of yeast Rpa12 and Rpc11, the Rpb9-like subunits of Pols I and III, respectively, form separate clades ( Figure 1 ). Both Arabidopsis Rpb9 orthologs copurify with affinity-purified RNA polymerases II, IV, or V (), such that their comprehensive names are NRP(B/D/E)9a and NRP(B/D/E)9b. Despite the fact that the two proteins differ at only 8 of their 114 amino acids, we show here that these ninth subunit variants are incompletely redundant for Pol II and nonredundant for Pol V functions.\n\nHuman, Drosophila, zebrafish, Chlamydomonas, Arabidopsis, poplar, maize, or rice proteins homologous to yeast (S. cerevisiae) Rpb9 (Pol II), or its Pol I or Pol III paralogs, were identified by searching the NCBI Reference Sequence (RefSeq) or maizeGBD (in the case of Zea mays GRMZM2G009673) databases using BLASTp. Multiple alignment of the sequences was conducted using MUSCLE (see Figure S1 ) in order to generate the phylogenetic tree. Bootstrap values are indicated for each branchpoint.\n\nIn yeast, the 12 Pol II subunits are each encoded by unique genes, ten of which are essential. One of the nonessential genes encodes the ninth-largest subunit, Rpb9. rpb9 deletion strains are viable, but temperature-sensitive (). Rpb9 is implicated in multiple aspects of polymerase II function, including initiation (), processivity (), transcriptional fidelity, proofreading (), and transcription-coupled DNA repair ().\n\nArabidopsis thaliana Pols II, IV, and V each have 12 core subunits (). Pol II, IV, and V largest subunits are encoded by unique genes: NRPB1, NRPD1, and NRPE1, respectively (\"NRP\" denotes \"Nuclear RNA Polymerase\"; \"B, D, and E,\" as the second, fourth, and fifth letters of the alphabet, denote Pols II, IV, or V; the numeral 1 indicates the largest subunit). Pol IV and V second-largest subunits are encoded by the same gene, NRP(D/E)2, which is distinct from the corresponding Pol II subunit gene, NRPB2 (). The two largest subunits interact to form the catalytic center for RNA synthesis, with noncatalytic subunits playing structural and regulatory roles for initiation, elongation, termination, or RNA processing (). Most of the noncatalytic subunits of Pols II, IV, and V are encoded by the same genes ().\n\nPol IV and Pol V functions are best understood with respect to RNA-directed DNA methylation (), a process in which 24 nt short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) direct the cytosine methylation, and silencing, of complementary DNA sequences. Pol IV acts early in the pathway, working in partnership with RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2 to produce double-stranded RNAs that are diced into siRNAs and loaded (primarily) into ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4) (). Independent of siRNA biogenesis, Pol V generates RNA transcripts at loci that undergo RdDM () and AGO4 binds these Pol V transcripts () as well as Pol V itself ().

After 2112, we were guitar, bass and drums and ambitious, so we thought maybe we should add another musician. But then it was, no, let's expand our own arsenal, so the guys started getting into acoustic guitar, bass pedals were just coming out, and I started expanding my drums, which would give us a great orchestration ability. Those subsequent albums are us learning to use all that, having fun, experimenting, as genuine as can be. When I look back on that it's an indulgent smile. We would later do better but there was nothing wrong with it. I described it once as young, foolish and brave.\"\n\n9: \"Time Stands Still\"\n\nAlbum: Hold Your Fire (1987)\n\nPeart: \"A song I still really like. Autobiographical in a sense. The whole thing of wanting to slow things down and absorb the moment. Feel this moment a little bit stronger, since we can't adjust the time to have more. I get frustrated when people say where did the time go. You just weren't paying attention. A day is a day, a month is a month, a year is a year. For me, it started in 1986, I remember sitting down and writing why 1986 was the greatest year ever.

It's probably one of our best in that sense being a short movie, and every section is a cinematic accompaniment to the lyrics. It's still one I really like and it's great to play live.\"\n\n6: \"Limelight\"\n\nAlbum: Moving Pictures (1981)\n\nPeart: \"An attempt to clarify for myself and hopefully others a thing that I learned: never complain, never explain. I try not to complain, but I can't help but to explain. That was an attempt on my part to explain myself as an introvert, feeling totally alienated by the 'guilded cage' of it all, and it's been remarkable over time how many young musicians have come up to me and told me what that song means to them when they faced the same transition in their life. It's supply and demand: as a young musician, you're all about supply and there is no demand, and then as soon as you get a little popularity there is demand, but the supply is the same, there is still just you, and it's a very difficult transition to weather\u2026. You can't complain, but other musicians will say to me, that song 'Limelight,' I get it.'\"\n\n5: \"Subdivisions\"\n\nAlbum: Signals (1982)\n\nPeart: \"Hugely autobiographical of course. It was an important step for us, the first song written that was keyboard-based. The upside of that: people don't realize is that it made Alex [Lifeson] and I the rhythm section.

I am not an economist or financial analyst. Reed Elsevier and other publicly traded corporations are required to publish their financial results. If you are looking for an appropriate citation for Elsevier profits, please read and cite the Elsevier annual report. If you are directed here by a citation incorrectly identifying me as an expert in this area, please let the citing source know that they are in error. If you are interested in my actual research area, please see my current research blog sustainingknowledgecommons.org The Reed Elsevier annual report was published in March. One highlight of interest in the area of scholarly publishing is the revenue and adjusted operating profit for the Scientific, Technical & Medical portion of the business. STM 2013 revenue: \u00a32,126 million STM 2013 adjusted operating profit: \u00a3826 million That's a profit margin of 39%! Revenue is up 1% from 2012, while profit is up 6% from 2012 (Reed Elsevier 2014, p. 12). Elsevier's profit increased from \u00a3780 million in 2012 to \u00a3826 million in 2013. That's an increase in profit alone of \u00a346 million, or $76 million in U.S. dollars. As I've explained elsewhere (Morrison, 2013), the vast majority of revenue for scholarly journals comes from academic library budgets. Surely universities have better things to do with this kind of money than further increasing the profits of already highly profitable publishers? For example: $76 million dollars in extra profits to Elsevier could fund 760 academic positions at a rate of $100,000 per year - and this wouldn't even touch Elsevier's previously high profit rate! $76 million dollars in extra profits to Elsevier could fund over 12,000 student research assistantships at a rate of $6,000 each.

The latter gives more dramatic vividness, as we thus have the utterances of three of the great actors in the tragedy: here of the people, in Jeremiah 4:22 of Jehovah, in Jeremiah 4:23 of the prophet. The \"bowels\" were with the Hebrews thought of as the seat of all the strongest emotions, whether of sorrow, fear, or sympathy ( Job 30:27 Isaiah 16:11 ).\n\nAt my very heart.--Literally (reproducing the physical fact of palpitation), I writhe in pain; the walls of my heart! my heart moans for me. The verb for \"I am pained\" is often used for the \"travail\" or agony of childbirth (Isaiah 23:4; Isaiah 26:18).\n\nThou hast heard, O my soul . . .--Silence at such a time was impossible. The prophet, as in the language of strong emotion, addresses his own soul, his very self (Comp. Psalm 16:2; Psalm 42:5; Psalm 42:11).\n\nVerse 19.\n\nMy bowels\n\n\n\"My bowels! my bowels! I must writhe in pain!\n\nThe walls of my heart! My heart moaneth unto me!\n\nI cannot hold my peace!\n\nFor thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet,\n\nThe alarm of war!\"\n\nThe walls of my heart\n\n\nJump to Previous\n\nJump to Next\n\nLinks\n\n\n. It is doubted whether the speaker in vers. 19-21 is the prophet or the whole nation. Ver. 19 reminds us of Isaiah 15:5 Isaiah 16:11 and Isaiah 21:3, 4, and would be quite in harmony with the elegiac tone of our prophet elsewhere; the Targum too already regards the passage as an exclamation of the prophet. On the other hand, the phrase \"my tents\" (ver. 20) certainly implies that the people, or the pious section of the people, is the speaker. Both views may perhaps be united. The prophet may be the speaker in ver. 19, but simply (as is the case with so many of the psalmists) as the representative of his fellow-believers, whom in ver. 20 he brings on the stage more directly. Ver. 19 is best rendered as a series of exclamations -Observe, the \"soul\" hears; the \"heart\" is pained. So generally the one is more active, the other more passive. The Hebrew margin gives, for \"I must writhe,\" \"I must wait\" (comp. Micah 7:7 ); but this rendering does not suit the context.. A poetical way of saying, \"My heart beats.\"My bowels, my bowels,.... These are either the words of the people, unto whose heart the calamity reached, as in the preceding verse; or rather of the prophet, who either, from a sympathizing heart, expresses himself in this manner; or puts on an appearance of mourning and distress, in order to awaken his people to a sense of their condition. The repetition of the word is after the manner of persons in pain and uneasiness, as, \"my head, my head\", 2 Kings 4:19 I am pained at my very heart; as a woman in labour. In the Hebrew text it is, \"as the walls of my heart\" (e); meaning either his bowels, as before; or the \"praecordia\", the parts about the heart, which are as walls unto it; his grief had reached these walls, and was penetrating through them to his heart, and there was danger of breaking that:my heart makes a noise in me; palpitates, beats and throbs, being filled with fears and dread, with sorrow and concern, at what was coming on; it represents an aching heart, all in disorder and confusion:I cannot hold my peace; or be silent; must speak, and vent grief:because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war; Kimchi observes, he does not say \"my ears\", but \"my soul\"; for as yet he had not heard with his ears the sound of the trumpet; for the enemy was not yet come, but his soul heard by prophecy: here is a Keri and a Cetib, a reading and a writing; it is written \"I have heard\"; it is read \"thou hast heard\", which is followed by the Targum: the sense is the same, it is the hearing of the soul.

Bernanke: I'm 'puzzled' by the focus on Glass-Steagall\n\nBen Bernanke is \"a little puzzled\" by the focus of some Democratic presidential candidates on reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act as a means of regulating or breaking up financial institutions, the former Federal Reserve chairman said Wednesday.\n\nDemocratic candidates Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley have pledged to reinstate the Depression-era act that created a separation between commercial and investment banking, and was repealed in the 1990s when Bill Clinton was president. Hillary Clinton's proposal for Wall Street reform does not include an explicit call for the break-up of so-called \"too big to fail\" financial institutions.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"I'm actually a little puzzled by the focus on that particular provision,\" Bernanke said during a discussion with POLITICO's Ben White at an America's Fiscal Future event in Manhattan. \"I think that if you look at the actual, what happened a few years ago in the crisis, that Glass-Steagall was pretty irrelevant to it because you had banks like Wachovia or [Washington Mutual] that went bad because they made bad loans, and you had investment banks like Bear Stearns and Lehman that went bad because of their investment banking activities.\"\n\nEven if Glass-Steagall were still in place at the time of the financial crisis, \"it would have had no effect on most of these firms,\" he said, including AIG, which required massive and repeated bailouts.\n\n\"I think the only major financial institution that Glass-Steagall would have a major effect on is probably Citi, which still has some of the supermarket elements,\" Bernanke added.\n\nFor the most part, though, he remarked, \"it would just be an example of breaking up firms for the purpose of breaking them up without a clear rationale for doing that. I think there are other ways to simplify banks that would be more effective.\"\n\nPart of that, Bernanke said, is simplifying banks to make them smaller and more efficient.\n\n\"We are moving towards a situation where banks are now evaluating their own size and complexity in light of the fact that on the one hand, there are economic benefits to size, but on the other hand, it's becoming much tougher to be a big bank,\" he said, referencing the fact that larger banks \"are trying to shrink\" because they do not want to hold as much capital as is required of the largest institutions.\n\n\"You put the incentives in the right place and force banks to think about whether their size and complexity is justified in an economic sense, or whether it basically could be dispensed with and you could get simpler banks. I think over time, the pressure will be on banks to simplify,\" he added, touting the example of the liquidation authority under the Dodd-Frank Act that gives regulators the ability to more cleanly unwind a bank on the brink of collapse.\n\n\"Just breaking them into tiny little pieces, you're going to lose a lot of value if you do that, without thinking about what the economics is,\" he added."}

Over the past half century, an elaborate mythology about these ill effects has evolved, fueled by rumor, gossip and poor-quality research. In contrast, placebo-controlled randomized trials document that nonspecific side effects are not significantly more common with combined oral contraceptives than with inert pills. These reported nonspecific side effects may reflect the nocebo phenomenon (the inverse of a placebo): if women are told to expect noxious side effects, these complaints occur because of the power of suggestion. Alternatively, nonspecific complaints may simply reflect their background prevalence in the population. Because Level I evidence documents no important increase in nonspecific side effects with oral contraceptives, counseling about these side effects or including them in package labeling is unwarranted and probably unethical.

She said they'd spent much of the last two days in their hotel room. \"Thank God for Facebook,\" she added. \"That kept them entertained.\"\n\nAll city parks and the High Line are closed indefinitely. In Central Park at least 250 mature trees were felled by the storm, with benches and playgrounds damaged as well. \"It's all about keeping the public safe,\" said Doug Blonsky, president and CEO of the Central Park Conservancy.\n\nMost Broadway matinee and evening performances were expected to play as scheduled today. Cancellations included \"Evita,\" ''The Lion King,\" ''Mary Poppins\" and \"Scandalous.\"\n\nThomas Karlegott waited with his wife and another couple from Angelholm, Sweden, all on their first visit to New York, for the opening of the TKTS booth in Times Square today. He said they'd be happy with tickets to any show at all after wandering around a largely shuttered Manhattan for the last few days without doing much.\n\n\"We ate good food,\" he added with a smile, but admitted that they'd missed shopping and going to museums.\n\nSubways remained closed, making it difficult to get around. The Staten Island Ferry, a humble commuter boat that's popular with tourists because it offers a free, beautiful view of New York Harbor, was shut due to flooding in the ferry terminal. Yellow cabs were on the streets but hard to come by.\n\nLocal buses were running, but double-decker tour buses \u2014 normally a ubiquitous sight around the city \u2014 remained out of service today, though City Sights, Gray Line and other bus companies announced on their websites that they hoped to resume operations Thursday. Circle Line boat tours said via Twitter that they also hoped to resume Thursday.\n\nThe Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island were expected to remain closed at least until Saturday, according to their websites.\n\nTourism is the city's fifth largest industry, with an annual economic impact worth $52 billion, including $34.5 billion in direct spending. Nearly 51 million people visited New York City in 2011. The city's official tourism agency, NYC & Co., referred a request for comment to the mayor's office, which did not immediately respond.\n\nAmong those lining up at the Museum of Modern Art were Sophie Manisse and her two daughters from Lyon, France. \"We wanted to see the Halloween parade,\" she said, referring to the annual Greenwich Village event, which was canceled. Instead, they headed into MOMA, where Edvard Munch's \"The Scream\" went on display a week ago and seemed to symbolize the state of mind of many visitors.\n\n\"We're really upset,\" said Debbie Clinton, visiting the city from Liverpool, England, as they walked into the Empire State Building, one of the first of the city's major attractions to reopen Wednesday morning. \"We bought passes for all these attractions and we haven't used them.\" They were heading home Thursday.\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art also opened today, and the Guggenheim opened for one exhibition, \"Picasso Black and White.\"\n\nCrowds of would-be shoppers gathered outside Macy's and other stores today in anticipation of the doors opening.\n\n\"It's filled with tourists!\" reported Macy's spokeswoman Elina Kazan a few minutes after the store opened. She said they had limited staffing but saluted the workers who made it to 34th Street from the city's far-flung neighborhoods \"by any means possible. They walked, carpooled, bused or cabbed from the boroughs. Many waited for hours but made it in.\"\n\nSome visitors had a philosophical attitude.

UC would have to leave Fifth Third Arena for the 2016-17 season, with US Bank Arena and Cincinnati Gardens among several possibilities considered as a temporary home. It is expected that UC basketball will return to its campus arena for the 2017-18 season.\n\nThe plan would include a 360-degree seating bowl, and would replace the current rollaway bleachers with permanent seats. A new roof is planned along with upgrades to concessions, lighting and the heating and cooling systems. Retail kiosks for fans will be located in the upper bowl. Many upper level bench seats will be replaced with chairback seating.\n\nUC athletic director Mike Bohn could not immediately be reached for comment. Bohn and some UC staffers visited the Gardens on a fact-finding tour last month.\n\nUC also is in the midst of an $86 million renovation and expansion of its Nippert Stadium football facility, which is expected to reopen for the 2015 Bearcats football season on Sept. 5 against Alabama A&M."}

The wounds inflicted by a nationwide loss never fully heal, but most presidential also-rans maintain their dignity and avoid any appearance of being sore losers. Voters become irritated when losing candidates fail to comprehend a harsh and plain verdict. A candidate can never fully appreciate all the ways voters demurred from him or her, but the rejection cannot be denied.\n\nClinton: I was on track to win before Comey and WikiLeaks https://t.co/gfDsY35Ax2 pic.twitter.com/gvg8ppsCYk \u2014 The Hill (@thehill) May 3, 2017\n\nIn her attempt to shatter the glass ceiling, Secretary Clinton instead shattered the American tradition of being a good sport, of accepting one's failure with grace, and of teaching citizens that sometimes in losing we find an even deeper purpose.\n\nFor almost 30 years the Clintons have attempted to convince Americans that they are victims: of \"bimbos,\" of a \"vast right-wing conspiracy,\" of the White House staff, of the Department of Justice, of the Special Counsel. And now the HRC claim is that she was \"\u2026on the way to winning until the combination of Jim Comey's letter on October 28 and the Russian WikiLeaks.\"\n\nLying is quite an art form and one well practiced in politics. It is easy to lie in small ways to make things seem better, a practice that is often called \"spin.\" Deft spinners find the words to confuse observers as to the actual sober reality of political decisions, especially ones that have developed an odor. But the real dark talent is to convince unsuspecting voters that what they think is true is actually the opposite.\n\nThe election results of 2016 were not a fluke. The American people were not confused and voters have the Clintons figured out. They know the Clintons have dragged the country through the back alley of 1960s excess. The Clintons are far too willing to put the country through the trauma and turbulence that results from their desire to grow their bank accounts in tandem with their political power.\n\nConway rips Clinton for blaming loss on outside forces: You 'lost to a better candidate' https://t.co/eVuCpCLy9a pic.twitter.com/W7FW6h7oJ3 \u2014 The Hill (@thehill) May 3, 2017\n\nDid Comey deny Hillary Clinton the White House?

Comey had already permanently damaged his reputation by publicly flogging Secretary Clinton for her abuse of sensitive information and for her failure to give consistently honest answers to the FBI, without recommending corresponding legal punishments. If anything, Director Comey aided and abetted the Clinton campaign and only went public with his actions when pushed by Congress or in response to the sleaziness of Weinergate.\n\nTo be even clearer, there would not have been any FBI investigation if Hillary Clinton had simply followed the law on the custody of her government emails and sensitive government information. What doomed her candidacy was a maniacal desire for personal secrecy and her belief that adherence to government standards were akin to Leona Helmsley's view of paying taxes, they are for \"the little people.\"\n\nDid WikiLeaks cost her the election?

But some researchers question whether the program actually has such broad applications.\n\nGo is a complex ancient East Asian strategy game, played on a 19-by-19 grid. The open-ended game has more possible configurations than there are known atoms in the universe, according to the DeepMind researchers.\n\nThe open-ended nature of the game has made Go a \"grand challenge for artificial intelligence,\" the researchers say. It's far more complicated than chess. A computer beat out world chess champion Garry Kasparov two decades ago.\n\nDeepMind has trained previous versions of the program by giving it a database full of thousands of human-played games of Go. It was one of those versions that went on to beat top player Lee Sedol last year, grabbing international headlines.\n\nAlphaGo Zero takes a different approach.\n\nInstead of learning from human-played games, Silver says it was given the simple rules for Go and asked to play itself. AlphaGo Zero \"figures out only for itself, only from self-play, and without any human knowledge, without any human data, without any human examples or features or intervention from humans. It discovers how to play the game of Go completely from first principles.\"\n\nIn their study, the researchers describe the program using a term that is well-known to students of philosophy: Tabula rasa, which is Latin for \"blank slate.\"\n\nThey argue that starting with a blank slate is optimal because human data sets can be \"expensive, unreliable or simply unavailable.\" Data sets of human knowledge could also potentially \"impose a ceiling on the performance of systems trained in this manner.\"\n\nAs it trained, \"what we started to see was that AlphaGo Zero not only started to rediscover the common patterns and openings that humans tend to play,\" Silver said, \"it also learned them, discovered them, and ultimately discarded them in preference for its own variants that humans don't even know about or play at the moment.\"\n\nWhen matched with the version that defeated the world champion, AlphaGo Zero beat it 100 games to 0.\n\nThe researchers say that the benefit of tabula rasa learning is simple: It means that a program can \"learn for itself what knowledge is.\" This means it could be applied to other fields, they say, such as protein folding or reducing energy consumption.\n\nBut other researchers such as Gary Marcus, an entrepreneur and psychology professor at New York University who specializes in artificial intelligence, think that the paper overstates its findings.\n\nThe program hasn't mastered Go without human knowledge, he says, because \"actually prior knowledge has gone into the construction of the algorithm itself.\"\n\nHe adds: \"They're not putting explicit declarative knowledge of things other than the rules of Go in there, but there's a lot of implicit knowledge that the programmers have about how to construct machines to play problems like Go.\"\n\nShowing that the algorithm can build knowledge from scratch on other kinds of problems would be needed to prove the claim, he says \u2014 or else all they've proven is that it's an algorithm that is really good at Go.\n\nIn a written statement, DeepMind said that \"nothing in the AlphaGo Zero algorithm is specific to the game of Go\" and added that the team is \"currently applying the same algorithm to other sequential problems and are confident that this approach is generalisable to a large number of domains.\"\n\nThey provided no information about how the algorithm has fared in solving other problems.\n\nMarcus is generally critical of what he sees as a general bias in the AI field toward tabula rasa programming. He argues that \"in biology, actual human brains are not tabula rasa ... I don't see the principal theoretical reason why you should do that, why you should abandon lots of knowledge that we have about the world.\""}

Tom Price (R-Ga.), to run the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe choice, which Trump's transition team announced on Tuesday morning, would appear to signal Trump's determination to proceed with a major overhaul of federal health care programs \u2015 including not just Obamacare, which Republicans have sworn to repeal, but also Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nPrice, 62, practiced as an orthopedist for about two decades before winning election to the House of Representatives in 2005.\n\nOnce in Congress, Price gained notoriety for his right-wing views \u2015 first as chairman of the House Republican Study Committee, a group of conservative lawmakers, and then as a founding member of the Tea Party Caucus. A constant in his career has been a hostility to government interference with the practice of medicine.\n\nThat may help explain why Price has emerged one of Washington's most vocal and persistent critics of the Affordable Care Act. That law, which President Barack Obama signed in 2010, has helped more than 20 million people to get health insurance and made coverage available even to people with pre-existing medical conditions. It has also increased the underlying cost of insurance and raised taxes on the very wealthy.\n\nIn a prepared statement, Trump hailed Price as \"a renowned physician\" and \"go-to expert on healthcare policy. ... He is exceptionally qualified to shepherd our commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare and bring affordable and accessible healthcare to every American.\"\n\nDemocrats reacted to the news harshly, noting Price's history of criticizing major federal health programs \u2015 as well as his strong opposition to abortion rights.\n\n\"Congressman Price has proven to be far out of the mainstream of what Americans want when it comes to Medicare, the Affordable Care Act, and Planned Parenthood,\" said Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), the incoming minority leader. \"Nominating Congressman Price to be the HHS secretary is akin to asking the fox to guard the hen house.\"\n\nRepublicans have long promised that they would replace Obamacare, rather than simply repeal it. By tapping Price, Trump is enlisting one of the few Republican lawmakers who have actually taken that vow seriously \u2015 to the point of writing a detailed piece of legislation.\n\nThe \"Empowering Patients First Act,\" as it is known, would gut Obamacare's regulation of insurance plans, reduce the total financial assistance going to people buying private coverage and rescind entirely the law's expansion of Medicaid for the poorest Americans.\n\nInsurers could resume some of the practices that Obamacare now prohibits \u2015 like selling bare-bones plans and, in some cases, denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions. Price's proposal would offer people tax credits, but there'd be no guarantee the credits could actually pay for comprehensive coverage.\n\nThe result, according to one analysis, would be less government spending and regulation \u2015 as well as lower taxes on the rich. Many younger and healthier people would get access to cheaper insurance, particularly if they were comfortable with plans that had minimal coverage or gaps in benefits.\n\nBut a scheme like Price's would also mean fewer people covered and, almost certainly, less financial protection for people with the worst medical conditions.\n\n\"It would likely leave many of the 20 million people losing coverage they now receive under the Affordable Care Act without health insurance and going without needed care,\" Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told The Huffington Post.\n\nIn 2015, Price was a chief architect of legislation to repeal Obamacare using the budget reconciliation process \u2015 a special legislative procedure, reserved for certain fiscal matters, that is not subject to filibusters in the Senate.\n\nBoth the House and Senate passed a version of that bill earlier this year. And while Obama vetoed it, many Republicans are already pushing to use reconciliation as a way to get Obamacare repeal through Congress again in 2017 \u2015 after which Trump, as president, would presumably sign it.\n\nAnd Price has said he wouldn't stop with Obamacare. In mid-November, not long after the presidential election, Price said that Republicans could also use reconciliation to change Medicare, as well.\n\nHouse Republicans, led by Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, have long called for converting Medicare into some kind of voucher scheme, in which seniors would get a fixed sum of money with which to choose a health plan.\n\nPrice has also endorsed transforming Medicaid into a \"block grant\" \u2015 in other words, giving states a fixed sum of money with which to run the program and then reducing the federal government's spending on it.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump indicated he would not cut either Medicare or Medicaid. But language on his new transition website says that he will \"modernize\" Medicare and give states more \"flexibility\" over Medicaid. In Washington, those terms are typically euphemisms for privatizing Medicare and transforming Medicaid into a block grant."}

Likewise, riders who qualified tenth or lower in Superpole could finish inside the top nine in race one.\n\nThe complexity continues with the following system then being used to allocate the top nine grid places for race two:\n\n* The top three riders in race one will move back to row three, and see 1st and 3rd reverse their positions.

You think you're a rebel, spelling his name tRump like a naughty eight year old kid from the forties? It's because \"rump\" means \"butt\", right? Is that the gag? Be careful you don't cut yourself on all that edge there, Lenny Bruce.\n\nI don't expect this article to share particularly well. Progressives are still too intimidated by their liberal friends and acquaintances to openly defy the infamous echo chamber on the social media outlets I get most of my exposure on, but this is getting intensely stupid and somebody needs to say something. The way people are championing a cause that's also being championed by every multimillionaire on every channel on every show on every television as though they're being in some way rebellious and counter-cultural is beyond my understanding. The resignation of a National Security Advisor (a registered Democrat, by the way) who was working against the oligarchic push toward a military confrontation with a nuclear superpower, who was one of the few people telling the truth about America's arming of terrorists in Syria, and Democrats are singing and dancing like a bunch of Ewoks watching an exploding imperial death star.\n\nLet me remind you gangstas that a 2014 Princeton University study showed clearly that the United States of America is an oligarchy, not a democracy. Here's a five-minute video breaking down what that means and how it works in clear and simple terms. Basically, in the current system, your wishes have essentially no impact on your country's legislation and policy unless you are very rich; your vote and the votes of the rest of the 99 percent change functionally nothing about the way your nation moves and behaves. So the fact that this guy was democratically elected to be the leader of the nation doesn't mean that he's actually in charge; ultimately, the real source of power is the large network of oligarchs and unelected manipulators collectively known as the Deep State.\n\nThat is what Bernie Sanders kept talking about when he spoke of America becoming an oligarchy, and that is where the real rebellion is. It is also the source of all of the current administration's internal struggles right now.\n\nAnd this does indeed seem to be the major source of confusion and/or manipulation on America's political left. Clintonian liberals were having a hard time being branded as proponents of the political establishment; they were the squares, the obedient, color-inside-the-lines brown nosers of the rich and powerful. Remember those 'Bernie vs. Hillary' memes? That.\n\nBut then when Trump won, they took this as a sign that they get to be the cool kids now, because \"Look! Now he's in charge! That makes him the establishment, right?\"\n\nWrong. The Deep State goes very deep, and the power structures entrenched therein are very old. The POTUS faces a long, hard, uphill slugfest of a battle in his attempts to restructure America's power systems, and the majority in both parties openly or secretly hate him and his stated agendas. It's still far too early to tell if Trump's new power dynamics will be more beneficial for America than the old ones, but he is clearly in conflict with the neoliberal power structures that have been choking America to death for generations.\n\nIt's not a coincidence that it was the Washington Post who originally broke the story of Flynn's phone call to Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in one of its notorious reports from \"anonymous sources\" in the intelligence community, for example. WaPo is owned by Jeff Bezos, who as the fifth-wealthiest person on the planet makes Donald Trump look like a high school janitor, and who has personally received hundreds of millions of dollars directly from the CIA. WaPo has consistently been a devout mouthpiece for the political establishment, running sixteen smear pieces in sixteen hours against Bernie Sanders at the most heated and contentious period in the Democratic primaries, and running fake story after fake story fanning the flames of public hostility toward Russia. This is the Deep State at work, my liberal brothers and sisters, and it's working against Trump, not your buddies in the Democratic party.\n\nThis is not a defense of Trump; I see Trump as largely irrelevant and very low on the list of priorities America's political left should be focusing on. This is simply a reminder to liberal Americans that you cannot attack Trump without propping up the Democratic establishment, and you cannot prop up the Democratic establishment without supporting the oligarchs who own it. When you celebrate the Deep State's counteroffensives against the Trump administration, you are not cool, you are not anti-establishment, and you are not a rebel.

He threw for 264 yards, 1 touchdown and 0 interceptions, with a passer rating of 73.0. He did showcase some flaws as well, but that is expected for your first start.\n\nIn his second start of the season vs the Miami Dolphins, Garoppolo looked phenomenal. He was making great passes down the field, looked poised in the pocket, and showcased his arm strength. Before getting injured near the end of the first half, he threw for 234 yards, 3 touchdowns and 0 interceptions, with a passer rating of 98.9.\n\nEven though we only saw a sample size of Garoppolo in only two starts in the league, he looked pretty good in those two starts.\n\nHe still needs to work on some stuff, but at the end of the day, Garoppolo has a bright future as a starting quarterback. He is a duel threat, and if he can not find a receiver open, he can run with the ball for a good chunk of yards.\n\nDespite the amazing numbers that Brady produces season after season, he does not have a lot of years left in the league, with him being 39-years old.\n\nThe team has to think of a backup plan for the future, and that is where Garoppolo comes in, as he showcased his potential in his first two starts in the league.\n\nTeams like the Cleveland Browns, Chicago Bears, and the San Fransisco 49ers will be interested in Garoppolo, due to the fact that these teams will be looking for a young quarterback that can lead the franchise and be the face of it.\n\nOut of all of these teams, the most interested team will most likely be Cleveland or Chicago, if they can get rid of Jay Cutler's contract somehow in the future.\n\nThe value will him for be draft picks, most likely first and second round picks. For a team like New England that has a quarterback that is in his prime and a quarterback that has a bright future as a starter, getting a high 1st round pick for the prospect would be fair value.\n\nGaroppolo would be a great choice to replace Brady when he hangs up his cleats, as he is still young (24) that he has a great career ahead of him.\n\nOut of himself and Jacoby Brissett, Garoppolo is the better quarterback, considering he can throw the ball more accurately, is better in the pocket, and he has a better arm as well. Both quarterbacks have good upside, but Garoppolo's upside is much better than Brissett.\n\nAt the end of the day, the team should listen to offers for him, but the team should not trade him, since he has got so much potential and can be a great quarterback to lead the team after Brady retires.\n\nPhoto Credit Maddie Meyer/Getty Images\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle"}
{"id": 259462, "ended": true, "length": 920, "text": "\"Just because the Philippines or Vietnam are not as large as China doesn't mean that they can just be elbowed aside,\" said the US president. China's response? In effect, \"yes we can\". And that has become clear in the last few days. Aerial photography shows that China is using land reclamation to expand two islands in the Paracel Islands chain and to build or expand seven others in the Spratly group. Both island groups are in the South China Sea where China has drawn a so-called \"nine dash line\" that lolls like a great tongue dipping down and across the sea. Beijing's claims clash with those of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei. \"The bottom line\", says Alan Dupont, a professor of international security at NSW University, \"is that China is terraforming its way to control of the South China Sea by creating artificial islands and then militarising them.\" Dupont says \"it's pretty clear-cut\" that Beijing is seeking to \"control the South China Sea and the eastern approaches to the Malacca Straits, which is the key choke point for global shipping given that 50 per cent of global trade goes through there.\"\n\nThis is terribly awkward for governments around the world. Few will defend China's relentless expansionism, yet no one is prepared to stand in its way. Beijing's behaviour is in breach of an agreement it signed in 2002 with the ten-nation ASEAN group, the Association of South East Asian Nations. Under the pact, all governments forswore any destabilising action such as building new structures on the disputed islands. But the deal was non-binding. China has waged a years-long go-slow on negotiating a binding code of conduct for the region. Last week the Philippines asked its fellow ASEAN members to say something about it. China was \"poised to consolidate de facto control of the South China Sea,\" the country's Foreign Affairs Secretary, Albert Del Rosario, told his counterparts. \"ASEAN should assert its leadership, centrality and solidarity,\" he said. \"ASEAN must show the world that it has the resolve to act in the common interest.\"\n\nInstead ASEAN showed that it was weak, divided, and unwilling to confront China. It issued a communique expressing concern that land reclamation \"may undermine peace, security and stability in the South China Sea\" yet it failed to name China as the culprit. So ASEAN won't even talk about the problem openly, much less act. Three of the ASEAN countries were reportedly keen to take a tougher line with China \u2013 the Philippines, Vietnam and Indonesia \u2013 but were overruled by the majority. The Foreign Affairs Minister of the host country for the meeting, Malaysia's Anifah Aman said: \"ASEAN's stand is that we want to engage with China.\" He added, \"In short, we are not confrontational.\" That suits Beijing just fine. A few days later, a top Chinese military commander sought to reassure the US about its reef expansions. In a video hookup, China's chief of navy, Admiral Wu Shengli, told his US counterpart, Admiral Jonathan Greenert, that China's reclamation would not affect freedom of navigation or overflight. According to China's Defence Ministry, Admiral Wu told the American: \"We welcome international organisations, the US and relevant countries to use these facilities, when conditions are ripe, to conduct co-operation on humanitarian rescue and disaster relief.\"\n\nSo China is now setting the terms of access to territories which are not, under international law, even Chinese. In sum, it seems China has gotten away with it. As Alan Dupont says, this is \"part of China's strategy for becoming the pre-eminent nation in Asia, and perhaps eventually the pre-eminent nation in the world. This creates a very difficult problem for the Australian government to deal with.\" So far Australia has dealt with it the same way almost all countries have \u2013 by pretending that it's not really happening. The benefits of trade and investment with China are lucrative. Governments do not want to put trade relations at risk by confronting Beijing over its bad behaviour in taking territory from weaker states. In the US there is a growing realisation that American forbearance is failing. \"Washington needs a new grand strategy toward China that centres on balancing the rise of Chinese power rather than continuing to assist its ascendancy,\" writes a distinguished American strategist, Bob Blackwill, in a new report for the establishment Council on Foreign Relations."}

But the hike was also due \"to improved access to previously inaccessible areas of Borno state, where the IDP population is now well over 1.6 million.\"\n\nThe IOM said the new figure covered internally displaced people (IDPs) in the northeastern states of Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Taraba and Yobe as well as the central state of Nassarawa and Abuja.\n\nIt urged the government as well as the international community to step in quickly as many were in dire need of food and shelter.\n\n\"Many IDPs, especially in host communities, have yet to receive basic items including food and shelter,\" said Enira Krdzalic, IOM Nigeria Chief of Mission.\n\n\n- Suicide bombers -\n\n\n\"It is very important for the authorities and for humanitarian partners to speed up the delivery of adequate assistance to these people,\" she added.\n\nAttacks by Boko Haram, seeking to impose a strict Islamic system in northern Nigeria, have killed at least 15,000 people since 2009, with the group's campaign also waged across Nigeria's borders.\n\nIn recent weeks suicide bombers, many of them women, have staged attacks in Nigeria, Cameroon and Chad.\n\nThe IOM said the majority of those displaced (92%) now live in host communities while the remainder live in camps or camp-like sites.\n\nBut Manzo Ezekiel, spokesman for the state-run NEMA, said the agency was already aware of the increase in IDPs and denied this was solely due to the upsurge in Boko Haram attacks.\n\n\"We are aware of the new figure of 2.1 million displaced people but it should be noted that there were other factors that brought about the increase apart from the Boko conflict,\" he said.\n\n\"We have people displaced by communal violence in states like Nassarawa and Taraba included in the figure,\" he said.\n\nEzekiel said there were also thousands of Nigerians who fled the country but were just returning home.\n\n\"For example, some 9,000 Nigerians recently came back from Cameroon and were received and camped by NEMA in Adamawa state,\" he said.\n\nHe said the agency has been meeting the needs of the displaced people.\n\n\"NEMA is on ground providing them with food, shelter and drugs,\" he said.\n\n\"Our appeal is for those affected to come to the camps so that we can attend to them. We cannot go to people's homes to give relief to them. They have to come to the camps and the collection centres to receive support,\" he said.\n\nEzekiel said only eight percent are in the camps while the majority are staying with their host communities.\n\n\"For them to be reached, they have to register with NEMA so that we will know exactly those we have to take care of,\" he added.\n\nTo fight Boko Haram an 8,700-strong Multi-National Joint Task Force, drawing in Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon and Benin, is expected to deploy soon."}

{"id": 259466, "ended": true, "length": 732, "text": "247Sports\n\nOver the last decade, we've seen a surge of freshmen running backs making a major impact in the world of college football.\n\nFrom former South Carolina star Marcus Lattimore and former Auburn BCS National Championship Game offensive MVP Michael Dyer to last year's stud crop that consisted of Leonard Fournette (LSU), Nick Chubb (Georgia), Dalvin Cook (Florida State), Samaje Perine (Oklahoma) and Royce Freeman (Oregon), teams are more dependent on youngsters than ever before.\n\nFlorida freshman Jordan Scarlett isn't in that company yet, but he's one step closer.\n\nPart of the reason is the transfer of the rising sophomore running back and Birmingham Bowl MVP Adam Lane. Florida announced the transfer of the Winter Haven, Florida, native on Sunday.\n\nLane rushed for 181 yards and a touchdown a year ago, including 109 in the bowl win over East Carolina.\n\nNow Scarlett has ascended to the consensus No. 2 spot on the running back depth chart behind established starter Kelvin Taylor. In just a few short practices, Scarlett\u2014a 5'11\", 210-pounder from Fort Lauderdale, Florida\u2014has been wildly impressive, according to Nick de la Torre of GatorCountry.com:\n\nThat's huge, because he has all of the skills to be a superstar once he gets his chance to shine.\n\nThe former Florida Atlantic and Miami 4-star commit was one of the prize signings of first-year head coach Jim McElwain's first recruiting class in Gainesville, and McElwain's ability to use multiple running backs throughout the year should help Scarlett earn significant snaps this fall.\n\n\"You're going to need three guys at least to go through the year with,\" McElwain said, according to quotes released by Florida. \"So what you hope to do is to find that guy that has the hot hand in the fourth quarter, okay. He's still fresh based on what you've done, and now let that guy kind of finish the game. That's kind of how we like to do it. Obviously, that has a lot to do with the development of those young guys.\"\n\nMake no mistake, the pressure is on Scarlett to be a key contributor from the moment toe meets leather in the season opener versus New Mexico State.\n\nRegardless of what you hear about the progress of the quarterback battle between redshirt freshman Will Grier and true sophomore Treon Harris, the Gators will be a run-first, power team. They're going to establish the run and then work off play action.\n\nWith quarterback and offensive line questions, it's tough to simply rely on the passing game undergoing an immediate turnaround, which means depth and creativity from McElwain and offensive coordinator Doug Nussmeier out of the running back position is paramount to the success of the 2015 Gators.\n\nScarlett was going to be a big part of that equation regardless of Lane's status, but now his development needs to be accelerated a bit in a transition year for the Gator program.\n\nHe has the talent, but now he has to grow up and learn the system in a hurry.\n\nQuotes were obtained firsthand unless otherwise noted.

The bodyguards were bruised and in tears as they were helped from vehicles, but they were alive, and the potential political crisis the episode could have set off seemed to have been averted for the moment. To celebrate their return, a sheep was slaughtered, women threw candies in the air and men fired long bursts of celebratory gunfire across the roofs of the densely packed Sunni neighborhood of Adhamiya.\n\n\"We are living in a jungle,\" Mr. Adhadh said in an interview at his home shortly after his release.\n\nA portion of Iraq \u2014 Mosul in the north and much of Anbar Province in the west \u2014 is under control of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. There are contested areas to the north and east of the capital, near Tikrit and Samarra and in Diyala Province, where fighting rages and where a brutal sectarian war seems to be unfolding. On Saturday, all five members of a Shiite family, including children, were found beheaded in the town of Taji. On Sunday, Shiite militiamen hung the bodies of at least six Sunni militants from streetlights and a bridge in Baquba, the capital of Diyala Province.\n\nIn Baghdad, though, where political leaders are struggling to keep the country together, a different picture has emerged. The wholesale sectarian slaughter that nearly tore the country apart in 2006 and 2007 has not yet returned, but militias, loyal to a sect or sometimes to just a man, are back. And the mass arrests of Sunni men, at the heart of grievances that allowed the insurgency to gain support within the Sunni community, have continued. It is a gangland culture deeply intertwined with the culture of Iraqi politics.\n\nThe effort to win Mr. Adhadh's release involved the new speaker of Parliament and Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, as well as pressure on Iraqi leaders from Western diplomats who feared that the episode would further destabilize the political situation and heighten sectarian tensions.\n\nBut it was the direct intervention of a powerful militia leader that ultimately secured Mr. Adhadh's freedom: Qais al-Khazali, the leader of Asaib Ahl al-Haq, a Shiite militant and political group with close ties to Iran. The group once fought the Americans, and more recently has fought in Syria's civil war on the side of the government of President Bashar al-Assad."}

I am going to do an Atlanta Braves franchise month-by-month, but I'll try my best not to flood the posts. If I find myself going quicker than I plan to, I will go year-by-year.\n\nAnyway, some initial thoughts and remarks on the franchise:\n\n\u2022 I am playing in Challenge Mode, so some settings are locked.\n\n\u2022 I will be using MLB only, no international leagues.\n\n\u2022 Simming every game, no matter what, even playoffs.\n\n\u2022 GM only, so won't be messing w/lineups day-to-day.\n\n\u2022 Settings are default unless noted below.\n\n\u2022 Aging speed for pitchers and hitters taken from 1.000 to .750 \u2014 on the recommendation of some here.\n\n\u2022 Challenge Mode sets trade difficulty at hard and preference at neutral.\n\n\u2022 Changed postseason roster eligibility to 40-man to reflect MLB rules.\n\n\u2022 Changed influence of popularity on All-Star voting to none.\n\n\u2022 Turned automatic evolution on, so it may get a bit nutty.\n\n\u2022 Team control settings are as follows: I will control active roster moves, major league transactions, trades, drafting, international FA, team personnel. AI will control lineups, pitching staff, budgets, all minor league transactions/staffs.\n\nOK, the boring stuff is out of the way, so let's talk about the Braves. At first glance, a few things jump out to me. One, they have the best farm system in baseball. Two, they have one of the worst contracts in baseball in LF Matt Kemp (3 years, $54M still owed). Team needs are: Frontline SP, long-term 3B, closer, long-term C.\n\nApril 2017\n\nOK, let's get started! To start each season in this series, I will list a few key pieces of information.\n\nOwner goals: Stay close to .500 and reach the playoffs in the next 5 years. Sounds reasonable.\n\nPayroll: $120M, 17th in MLB.\n\nTop 100 prospects: SS Dansby Swanson (5), RF Ronald Acuna (15), SP Ian Anderson (21), SP Sean Newcomb (24), SS Ozzie Albies (40), SP Bryse Wilson (46), SP Kolby Allard (72).\n\nRotation: Julio Teheran, Jaime Garcia, Mike Foltynewicz, R.A. Dickey, Josh Collmenter.\n\nLineup: RF Acuna, CF Ender Inciarte, LF Kemp, 1B Freddie Freeman, C Tyler Flowers, SS Swanson, 3B Rio Ruiz, 2B Brandon Phillips.\n\n$$ for FA: NONE\n\n$$ for extensions: $5.8M\n\nThe month and season got off to a pretty good start, with Atlanta winning five of the first seven games. Unfortunately, we would go just 7-10 the rest of the way, finishing the month at 12-12 (.500). That puts us third in the NL East, 7 1/2 games back, and 3 games back in the wildcard race.\n\nNo major transactions in the first month of the season, just trying to get a feel for the team, really. At the deadline I will probably look to move some of the pricey veterans \u2014 Kemp, RF Nick Markakis, RP Bartolo Colon, Garcia, etc. \u2014 just to give us some wiggle room financially next offseason. But, we will have to see where we are at that time.\n\nRP Arodys Vizcaino went on the 10-day DL with a strained ab, but that was the only notable injury this month.\n\nThe team struggled from the plate, as we are 13th in the NL in runs scored after April. Luckily, the staff picked up some of the slack \u2014 we're 4th in runs allowed.\n\nA big part of the offensive struggles were due to a rough debut from Acuna. He hit just .156/.204/.278 in 98 plate appearances in his first month in the majors. On the other hand, his backup, RF Nick Markakis, hit .364/.462/.636 in just 26 plate appearances. Manager Brian Snitker may want to make a lineup change there if things don't sort themselves out, but I appreciate his patience with the young stud.\n\nOn the mound, No. 1 starter Teheran went 3-1 with a 1.72 ERA in the first month, leading the staff as an ace should. There will eventually be some debate about whether we should trade Teheran, but his contract is so team-friendly I would lean toward keeping him during our contention window.\n\nIn other MLB news (thanks to u/"}

As a glaucoma patient, he learned in the 1970s that smoking cannabis reduced his inter-ocular eye pressure and helped to save his vision.\n\n\"It has helped me. I've been using cannabis every day since then, that I've been able to access it,\" Storck said.\n\nStorck founded the group \"Is My Medicine Legal Yet?\" or IMMLY.\n\nMedical marijuana is already legal in 20 states, and 14 others are considering medical marijuana laws this year.\n\nAs for Wisconsin...\n\n\"I don't think you're going to see anything serious anytime soon here, but if other states did, maybe in the next Legislative session there'd be more talk about it,\" Gov. Walker said.\n\nGov. Walker spoke with Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper at last week's National Governor's Assocation meeting, where Hickenlooper said his state would see $134 million in sales tax revenue for the year -- much higher than expected.\n\n\"He talked about the upsides of the revenue. He also talked about how they weren't rushing to spend that on other things because, he said, it's early and they're still concerned about the side effects,\" Gov. Walker said.\n\nDespite the fact that Rep. Sargent has introduced LRB 3671, the consensus among state law enforcement officials seems to be that marijuana is a \"gateway drug,\" and should remain illegal.\n\nGov. Walker agrees, but says he isn't completely shutting the door on this issue.\n\n\"It may be something that resonates in the future, but I just don't see any movement for it right now,\" Gov. Walker said.\n\nThat means for now, folks like Gary Storck must weigh criminal penalties against crippling pain.\n\n\"I have to buy it on the black market, like so many patients, and it's really sad because people want this medicine, they want legal access, but because our lawmakers haven't yet caught up with public opinion, they still have to break the law,\" Storck said.\n\nWhat do you think? Is Wisconsin ready for the legalization of marijuana?"}

They reported habitual nightly sleep durations between 6.5 h\u20138.5 h, habitual bedtimes between 2200h\u20130000h, and habitual awakenings between 0600h\u20130900h; these reports were confirmed objectively using actigraphy. They had no evidence of habitual napping, no sleep disturbances and an absence of extreme morningness or extreme eveningness, assessed by questionnaire61. Subjects were free of acute or chronic medical and psychological conditions, as established by interviews, clinical history, questionnaires, physical examinations and blood (including a fasting blood glucose test) and urine tests. They were nonsmokers and did not participate in shift work, transmeridian travel, or irregular sleep-wake routines in the 60 days prior to the study. Enrolled subjects were monitored at home with actigraphy, sleep-wake diaries, and time-stamped call-ins to assess bedtime and waketime during the week before and after the in-laboratory phase. They were not permitted to use caffeine, alcohol, tobacco and medications (except oral contraceptives) in the week before the laboratory study, as verified by urine screenings. Sleep disorders were excluded by a night of laboratory polysomnography and oximetry measurements.\n\nThe study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Pennsylvania.

The second fMRI scan session took place the next morning (total sleep deprivation [TSD] day or control day 1 [CD1]). Sleep-deprived subjects were then allowed 12 TIB for recovery sleep and control subjects were allowed 8 h TIB to sleep (Figure 6).

However, the Bill has been roundly criticized by industry experts for its potential overreach and vague language.\n\nThe bill could force tech companies to weaken their encryption\n\nIn the US tech firms' evidence, they note that the Bill could potentially force companies to introduce backdoors in their encryption. Although May has stated that the UK government does not wish to weaken encryption, the Bill itself includes \"obligations relating to the removal of electronic protection applied by a relevant operator to any communication or data.\" Facebook, Google, Microsoft, et al note that they have \"concerns\" about this wording, and would rather the Bill state explicitly that no company will be required \"to weaken or defeat its security measures.\"\n\nApple has also criticized the legislation\n\nSimilar worries have been expressed by Apple, which submitted its own evidence on the Investigatory Powers Bill last month. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in November that the proposed legislation could have \"dire consequences\" if introduced. \"If you halt or weaken encryption, the people that you hurt are not the folks that want to do bad things. It's the good people,\" said Cook. \"The other people know where to go.\"\n\nThe reaction of US tech firms to the legislation echoes corporate outcry following the Snowden revelations. Companies then made it clear that they do not want to lose users' trust, and cannot be seen to be complicit with government surveillance. (Although past evidence suggests companies were happy to help spy agencies in the past as long as nobody knew about it.) \"The ultimate test we apply to each of the authorities in this Bill is whether they will promote and maintain the trust users place in our technology,\" write the tech giants in the evidence published on Thursday, adding that the current provisions are \"a step in the wrong direction.\"\n\nHowever, the terrorist attacks of 2015 \u2014 including those in Paris in November \u2014 have hardened the debate around surveillance and encryption, and the most recent signs suggest the UK government is still determined to push forward with the Bill.

When the strike came, she weathered it, and the Labour party, tarred by the strike, was humiliated. In order to defeat the coming fuel drivers' strike, we want supplies of petrol stockpiled. Then, if the strike comes, we will weather it, and Labour, in hock to the Unite union, will be blamed.\"\n\nLabour immediately demanded an apology from the government.\n\nMaria Eagle, the shadow transport secretary, said: \"These allegations are outrageous. It is unacceptable that the Tory-led government have attempted to play politics with fuel supplies.\n\n\"People will be angry that David Cameron has inconvenienced millions in an attempt to create his own 'Thatcher moment'.

When Mrs Thatcher piled up the coal at power stations until the strike began in 1984, she was not inconveniencing the public.\n\n\"In 2012, the coalition is trying to press-gang the public, without saying so, into its political battles. All those people queuing on the forecourts were pawns in a government-organised blame-game.\"\n\nHe added: \"No doubt many people reading this column are happy that Ed Miliband's and Ed Balls's dependence on a large trade union should be exposed, but very few, I suspect, appreciate being made into mugs. (And the political effect, of course, is the opposite of that intended: Unite now looks virtuous, and is much better placed to win its demands.)\"\n\nLen McCluskey, the general secretary of Unite, said the government's \"posturing\" was scuppering chances for an end to the tanker drivers' dispute, which has caused motorists to queues at petrol pumps across the UK and stockpile fuel in order to pre-empt any strike that could lead to a fuel shortage. \"We call on the government to come clean on its whole approach to this dispute,\" said McCluskey. \"Is it acting as an honest broker, or is it spoiling for a fight in order to get itself out of the political hole its class-focused economic mismanagement has put it in?\n\n\"Over the last few days its every move has been designed to whip up unnecessary tension at the expense of the public. Ministers knew all along that a strike could not possibly be less than seven days away even were it to be called \u2013 that is the law. Yet they panicked the nation all the way to the petrol pumps because they imagined it would boost them in the polls.\n\n\"The British people know that this posturing and positioning is poisoning the prospects for an early resolution to the dispute.\"\n\nThe government stands accused of mishandling the crisis by Labour MPs, who called for the resignation of Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude, who has faced a barrage of criticism from fire experts ever since advising motorists earlier this week to store jerry cans of fuel in their garages.\n\nCalls for his resignation came after a woman suffered serious burns while transferring petrol into a jerry can in her kitchen.\n\nThe government has since changed its advice to motorists after Unite, the union representing 2,000 fuel tanker drivers, ruled out the threat of strikes over Easter.

Club's survey of TV at its most distinctive.\n\nIn 1987, when the NFL players went on strike, Dan Clark briefly became a Los Angeles Ram, following through on a football dream that had carried him through college ball and the European pro leagues. The job didn't last, but roughly a year later Clark was back on a football field, as a featured extra on the HBO series 1st & Ten. Not long after that, he got an agent, Joe Kolkowitz, who specialized in finding bit parts for jocks and hunks. After a few months of making pennies as background beefcake on various TV shows, Clark was about to quit when he answered a casting-call ad in Backstage West, looking for athletes to take part in a new game show shooting at Universal Studios in Hollywood. That's how Dan Clark became \"Nitro\"\u2014one of the first American Gladiators.\n\nThe concept behind American Gladiators was simple: Take the big bodies, colorful characters, and hard hits of professional wrestling, but put them into an actual competition. The contestants\u2014also pre-selected for their physical fitness\u2014competed in a series of challenges against the show's cast of flashily attired, bulked-up Gladiators, hoping to score more points than opponents playing the same games against the same crew. Contestants and gladiators squared off in an oversized, futuristic arena, where they tried to knock each other down in elaborate obstacle courses. On TV this played a lot like the ABC's 1970s \"junk sports\" series Superstars, crossed with Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome.\n\nClark and the other Gladiators shot 13 first-season episodes in 1989, before anyone on the production team really knew whether this concept would work on TV. According to Clark's memoir Gladiator: A True Story Of 'Roids, Rage, And Redemption\u2014and in the commentary track by Clark, Raye \"Zap\" Hollitt, and Jim \"Laser\" Starr on Shout! Factory's American Gladiators: The Battle Begins DVD set\u2014at first they didn't play whole matches straight through. Instead, they taped all the footage they needed from each event, sometimes spending hours doing them over and over while waiting out the technical snafus common to a fledgling television production.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond the physical exhaustion of the Gladiators\u2014who had to endure a procession of fresh contestants\u2014the main problem with this setup was that the studio audience was drawn from tourists who'd paid good money to come to Universal Studios and then found themselves stuck at a taping of a show they didn't know, watching a game that didn't make any sense. (At a certain point, the staff stopped trying to fill all the seats and started painting faces on plywood to fool the camera.) In the conception stage, American Gladiators was much more fantastical, with the Gladiators themselves drawn as full-on, cartoony \"characters,\" and the arena presented as some kind of extra-dimensional realm, complete with an ominous hooded referee. The live audience found it all confusing.\n\nBut as the producers started shaping the footage, they discovered that the tournament itself was exciting, even without all the extra trappings. Beginning with the second half of season one\u2014which featured an entirely new set of contestants\u2014American Gladiators started playing up the sports angle and focusing less on the sword-and-sorcery. By the time the show was ready to start shooting the second half of its first season, a lot of the kinks had been ironed out and the weaker elements eliminated. All of which means that the mid-season \"recap\" show\u2014a sort of greatest hits from the first tournament\u2014stands now as a document of American Gladiators in its nascent form, before anyone involved knew that they were making one of the biggest syndicated TV hits of the 1990s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne indicator that this recap's a relic is the presence of Joe Theismann, who was the play-by-play man and announcer for the first half of the season, before his color commentator Mike Adamle took over. In the DVD commentary, the Gladiators don't have much to say about Theismann\u2014it's a pointed \"no comment\" all around\u2014but they love Adamle, whom Nitro calls not just the voice but \"the conscience\" of the show. That dynamic is evident even here in Theismann's final American Gladiators appearance, where he talks about personalities and body-slams while Adamle evaluates the contestants' technique and guts. Hailing the tournament's first champions, Adamle describes them as being Walter Mitty-like: just everyday weekend warriors, treating a made-up TV competition as though it were the Super Bowl.\n\nThis retrospective proceeds"}

He studies the evolution of sexual behavior in humans and other animals. His first book, Sex, Genes & Rock 'n' Roll: How Evolution has Shaped the Modern World recently won the Queensland Literary Award for Science Writing.\n\nSydney (CNN) -- In the mid-19th Century, two devastating floods of the Yellow River, and the famine that followed, ravaged northeastern China.\n\nOutlaw bands, known as nien, attracted young men in unprecedented numbers, aggregating into militias that wrought chaos on the troops and infrastructure of the ruling Qing. Although this Nien Rebellion and the larger Taiping rebellion in the South were eventually crushed, they devastated the Chinese economy and contributed to the ending of the Qing dynasty.\n\nAccording to political scientists Valerie Hudson and Andrea den Boer, widespread female infanticide during the famine meant that as many as one quarter of young men in the region were \"bare branches\" -- as the Chinese expression goes -- unlikely ever to bear fruit. The Nien rebellion, they argued, was propelled by these surplus young men who had so few other prospects.\n\nThis story of the Nien Rebellion foreshadows one of the biggest issues that China will face in coming decades: the dramatic excess of young men.\n\nRead: Could China's one-child policy change?\n\nA long history of son preference, particularly among the Han majority, has led to female infanticide and the neglect of daughters in some parts of China. But in recent decades, the spread of cheap ultrasound (enabling sex-determination in early-mid pregnancy) and easy access to abortion courtesy of the government's one-child policy, has led to the widespread abortion of female fetuses.\n\nAs a result, approximately 30 million more men than women will reach adulthood and enter China's mating market by 2020.\n\nThe scale of this current sex-ratio bias dwarves that in the Nien rebellion, and the consequences could turn out to be more catastrophic.\n\nYoung men with poor prospects of ever starting a family spell danger to themselves and to their societies. Over millions of years of evolution, large numbers of women and even larger numbers of men left no offspring at all. Yet everyone alive today descends from ancestors who managed to avoid that fate. Our male ancestors were the ones who strove most frantically for status and the respect of their peers, and who won the chance to mate.\n\nAs a result, young men are hair-trigger sensitive to their circumstances, and when the number of men who will never find a mate rises, so does the intensity of the striving. Young men discount their futures and take ridiculous risks in order to improve their prospects. They also become more violent, rising more readily to perceived slights and insults, and starting more fights -- often over trivial issues. These are the triggers for most man-on-man assaults and homicides.\n\nMany factors contribute to the number of men who will never find a mate. Economic inequality, for one, leaves a great many poor young men unable to attract a wife. When a society allows powerful men to take several wives, too few women remain for many poor men to take even a single wife. But most dramatically of all, male-biased sex ratios consign the excess men to never having a family of their own.\n\nUnder each of these scenarios, large numbers of young men competing for dominance elevate local rates of violence, homicide and lawlessness. Martin Daly and Margo Wilson's studies show that local income inequality can explain variation in homicide rates on a number of scales: from Chicago neighborhoods to American States and Canadian provinces.\n\nThroughout history, a surplus of young men often heralded violence. The American frontier earned its \"Wild West\" reputation for lawlessness because its towns overflowed with men, yet marriageable women were vanishingly rare. In The Chivalrous Society, historian Georges Duby argued that European expansionism, from the Crusades to colonialism, was fueled by a surplus of ambitious and aggressive young men with otherwise poor reproductive prospects.\n\nChina is already feeling the effects of so many bare branches. The economist Lena Edlund estimates that every one percent increase in the sex ratio results in a six percent increase in the rates of violent and property crime. In addition, the parts of China with the most male-biased sex ratios are experiencing a variety of other maladies, all tied to the presence of too many young men. Gambling, alcohol and drug abuse, kidnapping and trafficking of women are rising steeply in China.\n\nThe bare branch problem will be compounded as income inequality rises. China's Gini coefficient of income inequality has risen from less than 0.3, 25 years ago, to almost 0.5 today. On the Gini scale, 0 represents perfect equality while a score of 1 represents complete inequality.\n\nIt would be difficult to over"}

Over the past many months, I've become friends with Eliane (and yes that's spelled correctly!) from Peppinas Hair on Facebook.\n\nShe too, has little girls and loves trying out different hairstyles and sharing them on her Facebook page. A while back she sent me some pictures of a fun new fishbone braid she'd come up with and wanted me to make a video of it. I've got to admit it took me a while to get it to look like I wanted it to \u2013 despite her detailed instructions! It's not really hard, but for whatever reason it didn't turn out quite like hers. I've come to the decision it's because of the amount of hair I was working with on Bee's ponytail vs. using a smaller amount of hair.\n\nThat being said, this video is to just show you the technique. You can do this anywhere on the head \u2013 not just a ponytail, and you can use any amount of hair to do it. I think if you work with less hair, you get an even cooler look.\n\n\nOnce you've watched the video and you try this, play around with it a bit to see what works best for you. Plait 4, 6 or even 8 sections and then twist it to see how it looks. Depending on the amount of hair you are working with will also change the look of the twist.\n\nThe next 3 pictures are courtesy of Eliane of Peppinas Hair showing a couple different styles she made using this fun new fishbone braid.\n\nIf you use smaller amounts of hair like she does below, it gives it a whole different look.\n\nStep 1 \u2013 Make a ponytail\n\nStep 2 \u2013 Divide hair into 2 sections\n\nStep 3 \u2013 Start plaiting a regular fishbone braid\n\nYou can do 4-8 plaits at this point. Play around with this and do what you think looks best with the amount of hair you're working with.\n\nStep 4 \u2013 Turn the entire braid 180 degrees to the right\n\nStep 5 \u2013 Plait an inverse fishbone braid\n\nIf you don't know how to do that, you'll just be taking hair and passing it under the braid instead of over. Do another 4-8 plaits inverted.\n\nStep 6 \u2013 Turn or rotate the braid 180 degrees to the right again\n\nStep 7 \u2013 Repeat Steps 3-6 until you reach the end of the ponytail\n\nStep 8 \u2013 Secure the end with an elastic\n\nLet us know what you think. This is definitely one we will be incorporating into some fun new styles in the future. And a huge thank you to Eliane for sharing her technique with us so we could share it with you. Be sure to share this pretty style and use those little social media buttons below!"}

Think about that.\n\nContinue Reading Below Advertisement\n\nSo what can you do?\n\nHaha, wouldn't it be amazing if I actually had a one-sentence cure for the plague of the industrialized world? The closest I could offer would be \"Have you tried just not giving a shit?\" but that won't do. You have to give a certain number of shits just to stay alive. For every truly carefree person I know, there's a nervous friend or family member who has to keep a \"bail out my carefree friend\" fund on hand for the next time that free spirit gets an eviction notice.\n\nNo, my plan is slightly more detailed, in that it has two parts instead of just the one:\n\n1. Recognize that your attention is a limited resource which must be spent carefully ... and that pushing yourself too hard can put you in the fucking ground.\n\n2. Realize that a lot of the things clamoring for your attention are the equivalent of inbox spam.\n\nThat is, it's junk mail sent by other people to trick you into feeling anxious in a way that will indirectly benefit them. The key is learning to filter it.\n\nSo if anxiety is intended to be a motivator for positive action, then you must only spend it on things that you can actually affect with action. Otherwise, it's spam. Examples:\n\nContinue Reading Below Advertisement\n\n-- You are made to feel ashamed about a personal attribute you have no control over (height, facial features, penis girth, race, gender, sexuality).\n\n-- You are upset because a person you are very nice to doesn't enjoy your company (you have no power over others' response to you).\n\n-- You feel a jolt of anger in your gut every time a religious/political/cultural group you find repulsive shows up in your news feed, upsetting you with their mere existence.\n\nNow, if the thing you are having anxiety about is something you can affect with action but is someone else's agenda, it's also spam. Examples:\n\n-- Someone is trying to shame you over your job/partner/body, even though you yourself are happy with them.\n\n-- Someone is trying to shame you for the harmless hobbies you enjoy.\n\n-- Someone is trying to shame you because your life doesn't look exactly like theirs.\n\nYou must learn to use the same technique taught in rehab and anger management classes: You have to stop, step outside of the emotion, and say, \"I am feeling anxiety about this. Should I?\"\n\nContinue Reading Below Advertisement\n\nIf the answer is no, you can now deploy that psychological trump card known as Not Giving A Shit.\n\nIt's not easy. It's a skill you'll have to practice for the rest of your life. Still, recognizing the need to do it is a massive step, since most of us accept anxiety as the background noise of everyday life (to the point where we actually get confused when it's not there, the way city folk get freaked out by natural silence when they try to go camping). This technique requires you to regard your own peace of mind as a precious resource that is under continuous assault, and to reflexively defend it. A sort of martial art of the mind which involves strategically deploying or withholding your shit-giving as needed. I call it Noshitsu.\n\nBut be warned: Your enemies have been honing their techniques for a very long time. Still, with vigilance and repetition, I know for a fact that you, too, can become a Noshitsu master.

Not much has changed since we last looked at his bike, but with a new team name \u2013 Trek Factory Racing \u2013 comes some minor tweaks.\n\nVoigt is the oldest rider in the peloton, and so it's only right that he receives a fitting race number \u2013 42, his exact age. That said, he's obviously still in form and his aggressive position hasn't changed much at all.\n\nVoigt rides a standard Trek Madone7 series frame with a H1 headtube, offering a lower position compared to Trek's regular H2 geometry.\n\nStanding slim and tall at 1.89m (6ft 2in), Voigt has a few component choices that help with a precise fit, and his choice of 177.5mm cranks isn't often seen. Trek's reverse seatpost topper means Voigt uses a longer seatpost head with minimal setback, all in an effort to get further over the pedals.\n\nThe move from Speedplay to Shimano pedals signals a minor change. Voigt prefers a wider stance and so the choice of Shimano's Dura-ace pedals with wider axles adds a further 8mm to his Q-factor.\n\nLike the rest of the team (except Fabian Cancellara), Voigt uses the new 11-speed Dura-ace 9070 Di2 groupset with internal battery. Unseen in 2013, a Climber shifter has been added for extended efforts without moving from the top of the bar.\n\nEven though Bontrager offer a range of carbon handlebars, Voigt sticks with an aluminium model due to post-crash dependability.\n\nComplete bike specifications\n\n\n\u2022 Frame: Trek Madone 7 Series, 60cm H1 Team Issue\n\n\u2022 Fork: Trek Madone KVF full carbon\n\n\u2022 Headset: Internal 1 1/8in to 1 1/2in tapered\n\n\u2022 Stem: Bontrager Race XXX Lite, 120mm x -7 degrees\n\n\u2022 Handlebar: Bontrager Race Lite Anatomic, 44cm (c-c)\n\n\u2022 Tape: Bontrager cork\n\n\u2022 Front brake: Shimano Dura-Ace direct mount BR-9010\n\n\u2022 Rear brake: Shimano Dura-Ace direct mount\n\n\u2022 Brake levers: Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 STI Dual Control ST-9070\n\n\u2022 Front derailleur: Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 FD-9070\n\n\u2022 Rear derailleur: Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 RD-9070\n\n\u2022 Shift levers: Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 STI Dual Control ST-9070 + Climber shifter\n\n\u2022 Cassette: Shimano Dura-Ace CS-9000, 11-25T\n\n\u2022 Chain: Shimano Dura-Ace CN-9000\n\n\u2022 Crankset: SRM Wireless PowerMeterDuraAce 9000, 177.5mm, 53/39T\n\n\u2022 Bottom bracket: BB90 stainless steel cartridge bearing\n\n\u2022 Pedals: Shimano 9000 Dura-ace Wide spindle\n\n\u2022 Wheelset: Bontrager Aeolus 5 tubular\n\n\u2022 Front tire: Schwalbe One 24mm\n\n\u2022 Rear tire: Schwalbe One 24mm\n\n\u2022 Saddle: Bontrager Team Issue - Soft\n\n\u2022 Seatpost: Madone Long 5mm setback\n\n\u2022 Bottle cages: Bontrager RXL bottle cage (2)\n\n\u2022 Computer: SRM PowerControl 7\n\nCritical measurements\n\n\n\u2022 Rider's height: 1.89m (6ft 2in)\n\n\u2022 Rider's weight: 76kg (167.2lb)\n\n\u2022 Saddle height from BB, c-t: 842mm\n\n\u2022 Saddle setback: 94\n\n\u2022 Seat tube length (c-t): 573mm\n\n\u2022 Seat tube length (c-c): 510mm\n\n\u2022 Tip of saddle to center of bar: 610mm\n\n\u2022 Saddle"}

I love my curvaceous figure and my soft, supple skin. I am an athletic, healthy, and shapely young woman with a great attitude, a lust for life, and an eagerness to explore what the future has to offer. Also, I'm sexy as hell and I know how to work my voluptuous body to amply and utterly please my numerous lovers.\n\nHowever, I didn't always feel this way about myself and my body. As an average, middle class girl growing up in the Western United States, I was subjected to the usual trials and tribulations of an American teenager. Being a little on the curvy side, I quickly noticed that I looked very different from the vast majority of girls portrayed on television, online, and in fashion magazines. I remember being in my early teens and picking up an issue of Teen Vogue with a picture of Emma Watson on the cover and a headline that said something like \"Tips on what to wear if you're curvy, short, thin, etc.\" I remember paging through the magazine and getting very depressed because I realized that I wanted to be the lithe, slender Emma Watson type that's pretty enough for the cover of the magazine and not the full-figured model in the middle of the book showing off the merits of fit and flare dresses.\n\nLike many young women, I became obsessed with my appearance and I spent more time than I should've looking at myself in front of a mirror and obsessing over every bulge and valley of my body \u2014 to the point where my \"flaws\" became exaggerated in my mind, and began to affect the way I perceived myself. When you're young and susceptible to the pressures of society, a negative body image can make you feel as if you're less than worthy of certain things because you can't see yourself in empowering roles that are almost always portrayed in the media by women that don't look like you. I began to have thoughts like, \"Well, I should settle for this unfulfilling relationship or this crappy part-time job \u2014 after all, what more should a girl like me expect out of life.\" I could never be \"the star,\" because women that look like me are the supporting characters.\n\nOf course, you would never know that I had these hangups if you met me in high school. I had a bubbly personality, I received decent grades, I had healthy friendships, I dated, and I had the usual amount of moderately enjoyable sex. But there was always a barrier, an invisible and imaginary limitation that I put on myself no matter what I did in life. Like too many teenaged women on the cusp of adulthood, these negative thoughts about my body eventually got situated into my subconscious and became a part of me that was always present but barely perceptible, limiting my potential in every aspect of my life.\n\nAfter high school I moved to the Pacific Northwest and I had my first taste of independence, which meant that I was dead broke and had to find a job to pay the bills ASAP. Although being a barista in several of the the seemingly unlimited coffee shops Seattle has to offer was a lot of fun and a great way to make new friends, it wasn't long before I realized that I needed to get a higher paying job if I wanted to stay on my feet and save some money.\n\nSeveral of the women I met at the coffee shop were sex workers of one sort or another, and they suggested I get involved in adult entertainment. At first I thought that this was something I could never do. I mean, I could never be a sex symbol. That role was for the girls who were on the magazine's cover, not the fit and flare dress girls.\n\nFortunately, the need for cash superseded my personal hangups and I got involved with exotic dancing and adult videos. As I experimented more and delved deeper into the world of adult entertainment, something began to happen. People began to treat me like I was something extraordinary. I began to make more and more money and I received sexual offers from men and women alike. I was desired \u2014 someone to be exalted and revered. Someone that people would pay to experience an evening with. People wanted me \u2014 wanted my body. Slowly but steadily, the barriers that were preventing me from seeing myself as a beautiful, amazing, and absolutely worthy person were beginning to crumble.\n\nBy the time I decided to become a legal working girl at Dennis Hof's Sagebrush Ranch in Nevada, so that I could offer intimacy and sensuality to my newfound suitors, the wall impeding me from loving myself was all but shattered. Through my work as a licensed courtesan, I learned that people lust after and crave a variety of body types \u2014 and I learned that what people see in magazines and"}

{"id": 259494, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "One of Obamacare's biggest selling points for women is the guarantee of no-cost birth control, a new benefit that includes all forms of contraception from the pill to tubal ligation.\n\nBut two years after the rules eliminating copayments for contraceptives took effect, some women are still forking over cash to the pharmacist when they pick up their pills or at the doctor's office when they obtain other forms of birth control.\n\nJust last week, CVS announced it would send rebates to 11,000 women who were erroneously charged for their birth control pills at the company's stores because of a computer error. The snafu came to light when an aide to Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) had to pay $20 for birth control at a Washington CVS, which prompted an inquiry by the lawmaker.\n\nSo did President Barack Obama break a promise? Are health insurance companies and drugstores picking women's pockets?\n\nThe good news is that neither of those things is true, and eventually almost all women with health coverage won't have to pay a dime when they obtain contraceptives. The bad news is that it's a little complicated. Because of course it is. This is the American health care system, after all.\n\n\"American women don't really know what all the rules are,\" said Judy Waxman, vice president for health and reproductive rights at the National Women's Law Center. \"All this is relatively new, and it's working fairly well. It just needs to be cleaned up and work better.\"\n\nSome health insurance plans aren't yet required to comply with this part of Obamacare. Others never will have to cover birth control, such as those plans provided to employees of religious organizations. And as the CVS example illustrates, sometimes insurers and pharmacists just get it wrong, and women have to jump through hoops to set it straight.\n\n\"We do hear from women all over the country with what I will call glitches,\" Waxman said. \"Not everybody understands what they're supposed to be doing.\"\n\nFirst, the basics: The Affordable Care Act does require health insurance companies to cover all Food and Drug Administration-approved contraceptives -- including the pill, IUDs, the ring and the patch -- without any form of cost-sharing like copayments or deductibles. This requirement comes from the same part of the law that mandates no charges for preventive medicine, such as immunizations and cholesterol tests.\n\nIf you receive your health benefits from an employer and you're not sure whether you have to pay out-of-pocket to get contraception, you should ask a manager, the human resources office or the insurance company. If you buy health insurance on your own, check with the plan to find out what your contraceptive coverage is. All health insurance sold on the Obamacare exchanges includes no-cost birth control. If your insurance company still insists you owe copayments, you might have to file an appeal, Waxman said.\n\nIf you don't get straight answers from your employer or insurance provider, or if you feel like you're being ripped off, organizations such as the Planned Parenthood Action Fund and the National Women's Law Center can help, as can state insurance commissioners and the U.S. Department of Labor, Waxman said.\n\nDespite its shortcomings and the confusion around how it's supposed to work, the Obamacare birth control mandate has had a huge impact: Many, many more women have access to no-cost contraception than before the law took effect, as this chart from the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research organization, shows.\n\n\nSource: The Guttmacher Institute\n\nThe share of women who obtained oral contraceptives without copayments rose from 15 percent in 2012 to 67 percent this year, according to a survey by the Guttmacher Institute. Women who used an injectable contraceptive or the ring saw a similarly major improvement in their benefits, and those using IUDs saw a somewhat smaller increase.\n\nThe effect on women's pocketbooks is striking: Women using contraceptives saved $483 million in copayments last year, according to IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, a branch of IMS Health that tracks pharmaceutical sales. (Obamacare didn't exactly make contraceptives \"free,\" of course, because their cost now just gets included in the overall insurance cost.) The number of prescriptions filled for the pill also increased by 4.6 percent from the year before, IMS reported in April.\n\nTop bar in millions of prescriptions. Bottom bar in millions of dollars. Source: IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics\n\nThat's probably a big reason why this part of Obamacare is so popular. In a survey conducted this July, 60 percent of people said they supported mandated no-cost birth control, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation found. Still, one-third of Americans didn't know about the no-cost birth control benefit as recently as March, and only one-fifth said they'd heard a lot about it"}

But to assume that the Islamists will not be impacted, or moderated, by the responsibilities of power, by the contending new power centers here and by the priority of the public for jobs and clean government is to miss the dynamism of Egyptian politics today.\n\nCome with me to Cairo's dirt-poor Shubra el-Khema neighborhood and the dilapidated Omar Abdel Aziz School, where I watched the last round of voting on Wednesday at a women-only voting center. We were guided by Amr Hassan, a 22-year-old commerce student from the 'hood \u2014 a secular youth, who fought to topple the Hosni Mubarak regime in Tahrir Square last year.\n\nHere is what was so striking: virtually all the women we interviewed after the voting \u2014 all of whom were veiled, some with only slits for their eyes \u2014 said that they had voted for either the Muslim Brotherhood or the Salafists. But almost none said they had voted that way for religious reasons.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMany said they voted for Islamists because they were neighbors, people they knew, while secular liberal candidates had never once visited. Some illiterate elderly women confided that they could not read the ballot and just voted where their kids told them to. But practically all of them said they had voted for the Muslim Brotherhood or Salafist candidates because they expected them to deliver better, more honest government \u2014 not more mosques or liquor bans.\n\nPhoto\n\nHere are some quotes from Egyptian women on why they voted Islamist: \"I love the Muslim Brotherhood; they are the only honest ones. ... I want good education and clean air to breathe. ... We need proper medical care. ... I want my kids to be properly educated. They can't find any jobs. ... The Muslim Brotherhood is not just an Islamist party. It is going to help solve all the problems of the country. ... We have to get the youth working and to raise salaries. Education here is only getting worse. ... My biggest fear is lack of security. We sit in our homes \u2014 afraid.

That's the kind of information that raises eyebrows.\"\n\nOver 4,000 pharmaceuticals are currently in use or in development in the United States. Many of them are finding their way into rivers, streams, and lakes, raising concerns about how exposure could impact wildlife, or even humans who consume fish.\n\nRelated: The Amount of Plastic in the Ocean Could Outweigh Fish by 2050\n\nMeador's team focused on compounds that Americans pick up at their local pharmacy, or is frequently proscribed by doctors. Water samples from the sound, wastewater, and fish tissue were analyzed for the presence of 150 different types of chemicals.\n\nOne hundred and six wastewater treatment plants, discharging as much as 97,000 pounds of chemicals each year, are located around Puget Sound. Meador's team examined only two of them, but found ingredients from 81 drugs and personal-care products, at some of the highest concentrations in the country.\n\nHundreds of chemicals can be found in the waters of Puget Sound, but only a handful are regularly monitored by wastewater facilities, which require permits from Washington's Department of Ecology to operate. Chemical levels from pesticides, for example, must remain below a certain threshold before the water can be dumped into the sound. But pharmaceuticals, now ubiquitous in society, aren't monitored.\n\n\"There's a lot of chemicals that we already know cause problems for the salmon,\" said Amelia Apfel, who works with Puget Soundkeeper. \"It's concerning to learn that they are more things in the water that we don't even know about.\"\n\nWhile the presence of toxins sounds alarm bells for advocates like Apfel, more research is needed to understand the impact of chemicals on aquatic life, said Meador.\n\nFor example, metformin, a common diabetes medication, could hinder metabolic function, impacting a fish's growth. High exposure to antibiotics could result in antibiotic resistant bacteria, which could potentially lead to dangerous pathogens that could be passed along to people. Prozac or Zoloft, which might free a person from the grip of chronic depression, could very well negatively impact the behavior of fish.\n\n\"If that happens, the fish is toast.\" said Meador. \"It doesn't last long. Predators hunt fish that stray from normal behavior.\"\n\nRelated: Your Birth Control Pills and Hamburgers Might Be Making These Fish Intersex\n\nChinook salmon migrate from the ocean to river headwaters in order to spawn. Meador and his team studied the fish because they spend several weeks each year swimming in areas of high chemical concentration. In previous studies, Meador found that the salmon that migrate through chemical-laden wastewater die at nearly twice the rate of fish in cleaner waters. Staghorn sculpin, which are abundant in Puget Sound, were also tested.\n\nThe researchers found that salmon had higher rates of toxicity than sculpin, which was surprising because sculpin are bottom-feeding fish that spend more time in the region.\n\n\"But young salmon eat a lot,\" said Meador. \"They pass a lot of water over their gills, which allows the chemicals to be taken up into the gut of the fish.\"\n\nIt remains a challenge to figure out how to remove chemicals from waterways because the regulatory agencies aren't obligated to treat them like other pollutants. Meador hopes that by studying the impacts that everyday, household pharmaceuticals have on aquatic life, scientists will be better able to define a threshold for allowable levels of chemicals in the water.\n\n\"Several species of salmon are endangered,\" said Meador. \"In the past we've looked at PCP and DDT. Pharmaceuticals are the next frontier.\"\n\nFollow Elaisha Stokes on Twitter: @ElaishaStokes"}

Four government officials told NBC News that the investigation is looking into Michael Flynn Jr.'s work for his father's lobbying firm, the Flynn Intel Group, which has been under scrutiny for its ties to Russia and Turkey.\n\nFlynn Jr. was fired from Trump's transition team in December after the president reportedly became irritated by Flynn's persistent promotion of a false conspiracy theory alleging Hillary Clinton was behind a child sex-trafficking ring. The news of Flynn Jr.'s inclusion in the Russia probe comes one day after House Democrats sent a letter to Mueller raising concern about the former national security adviser's failure to disclose a 2015 trip to the Middle East, where Flynn senior may have lobbied on behalf of a foreign government to strike a deal to build a nuclear reactors program.\n\n\"The American people deserve to know whether General Flynn was secretly promoting the private interests of these businesses while he was a campaign adviser, a transition official, or President Trump's National Security Adviser,\" said the letter, signed by Rep.

In addition to the main Chromium repository, which includes all of Blink, there are over a hundred other open-source projects which Chromium incorporates by reference, totaling more than 48,000 C/C++ files and 40,000 header files. Porting Chromium on Windows to VC++ 2015 requires getting all of these projects to build and run.\n\nAs of March 11th 2016 Chromium for Windows has switched from VC++ 2013 to VC++ 2015, and it doesn't look like it's switching back. This will give us more C++ 11 features, new security options, much faster LTCG/PGO builds, and other advantages.\n\nThe tracking bug for this project currently has over 330 comments on it, with contributions from dozens of developers. Writing about all of those changes would require an entire book. So I'm going to focus on my favorite part of this project \u2013 compiler bugs. In particular, bugs where the compiler silently generates incorrect code.\n\nUpdate: another code-gen bug in VS 2015 was found on March 31st, and worked around about two weeks later. A VC++ bug was filed. And another silent-bad-code-gen bug was found in September 2016, and worked around a few days later.\n\nIf you throw a diverse enough set of code at a compiler, build it in lots of different ways, run lots of tests, and ship the code to customers, you're going to find some bugs.\n\nBecause Chromium is open source I will include links to Chromium bugs and fixes where possible, in addition to links to the VC++ bug reports.\n\nI didn't find all of these bugs, but it was my job to investigate them, come up with a minimal repro, and report them to Microsoft. And I have to say that the Microsoft team was amazing. They were very supportive, and helpful, and it was clear that they really wanted VC++ 2015 to be as good as possible, and that includes building Chromium. We had an excellent symbiotic relationship: I fed them high quality bug reports, and they fixed them incredibly quickly.\n\nAnyone can file VC++ bugs at the connect website. Getting your bugs noticed is easier if you work for Google, but anyone who files quality bugs can get help. The VC++ MVP program lets ordinary developers who participate in the VC++ community get privileged access to the VC++ team. Recommended \u2013 I enjoyed being a VC++ MVP before joining Google.\n\nChromium is open source so Microsoft can theoretically reproduce any of these bugs if I just tell them what source file to compile and where to look. But that can be a slow process. If the repro steps for your bug includes \"Download 90,000 source files and our custom build system and compile for hours\" then you can't expect priority service.\n\nThis is especially true because most reports of bugs in compilers are erroneous \u2013 most 'compiler bugs' are actually bugs in the code being compiled, such as invoking undefined behavior. So, I always had to prove to myself that these were compiler bugs before reporting them, which usually meant simplifying the repro case to make it trivially obvious that the compiler was at fault. I've discussed techniques for doing this before.\n\nFailed Chromium\n\nAfter getting all of Chromium building the next step was to start running Chromium. It would run fine once, but on subsequent runs I'd hit an assert. I suspected a code-gen bug but it was not the case. The problem ultimately turned out to be this code:\n\nHandleWrapper h(CreateMutex(\u2026));\n\nif (h.HandleIsInvalid() && GetLastError() == SOME_ERROR_CODE) \u2026\n\nIt turns out that the HandleWrapper class allocates memory, and the debug version of the VC++ 2015 CRT allocations functions call the FlsGetValue function, and FlsGetValue calls SetLastError(0) because it is so incredibly proud that it succeeded. SetLastError(0) destroys the error code from CreateMutex, and madness ensues. I filed a bug and tweeted about this and it turned into a fun little twitter discussion with opinions about evenly split between \"if memory allocation affects LastError then Armageddon is imminent\" and \"if you assume memory allocation won't affect LastError then you are Satan\".\n\nThis way of using HandleWrapper is very convenient and is pervasive in Chromium so fixing all of the uses seemed impractical so instead the HandleWrapper constructor now preserves and then restores LastError. Some other misuses of GetLastError were also fixed.\n\nThis was not a compiler code-gen bug, but I wanted to include it because the twitter storm was wonderful.\n\nMicrosoft decided to fix the bug which I assumes means that they are choosing Satan over Armageddon.\n\nFailed test\n\n"}

Break them Up!\" none of them can seem to tell you how big is too big or what \"breaking them up\" actually entails.\n\nHere's Barney\u2026\n\nThere is a fundamental weakness in the position of those who insist that the only way to deal with financial institutions that are \"too big to fail\" is to break them up: their acknowledgment that the central question of how big is \"too big\" is too hard to answer. This is rarely made explicit, but it is universal.\n\nAnd Barney named names\u2026\n\nAcross the ideological range from Sen.

The issue is how to avoid a situation in which an institution has incurred so much debt that its inability to pay threatens the stability of the financial system. In other words, how do we prevent a repetition of the damage caused by the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008? Therein lies their dilemma.\n\nEssentially, even Barney Frank is now saying that he would like to hear a more little nuance from the Bernie campaign than \"Banks bad!\" And that makes him \u2013 Barney f@cking Frank! \u2013 a compromised centrist in the eyes of many Bernie Bros who seem just fine wallowing in the public pool of generalized, detail-free bank hatred.\n\nFrank spends the rest of his column explaining and defending the untapped power of Dodd-Frank, so take that as you will, but this Barney/Bernie salvo casts an even brighter light on the Democratic party schism Hillary will have to furiously patch over once Bernie steps aside in the coming weeks or days.\n\nBarney Frank: Sanders's 'too big to fail' mantra ignores a huge problem [WaPo]"}

When we made the decision to close public last October, we received a huge response.\n\nTakayasu Watanabe, Hagoromo's last president\n\nMany of our customers stocked up on our chalk before it became unavailable. We received a flood of faxes and nonstop telephone calls, and could hardly keep up with orders. Initially, we had planned to discontinue production at the end of February. But after discussions with employees, we continued production until March 31.\n\nA lot of teachers use our chalk regularly. Teachers at elementary, junior-high and high schools around the country use it, as do those at large cram schools such as Kawaijuku Educational Institution and Yoyogi Seminar.\n\nTeachers appreciate our chalk because it is easy to write with and durable. In fact, it is difficult to break our chalk by hand. Characters written with our chalk on blackboards are easily identifiable. They beautifully express the strokes particular to Chinese characters.\n\nDemand halved\n\nWe did not close down without reason, even if our chalk is immensely popular.\n\nMy condition is one big reason we shut up shop. I have been in poor health for several years. Actually, I have been hospitalized. Nevertheless, I could not have someone else replace me as chief because, as a company in a declining sector, Hagoromo has been running at an operating loss in recent years.\n\nAnother reason is that the unit price of chalk plunged. We had to participate in auctions held by local governments in order to supply chalk to public schools. Recently, bid prices at auctions plummeted sharply. Contract prices were equivalent to our manufacturing costs.\n\nEarlier, companies based in a city, ward or town were given a priority at auctions held by their governments. These days, local governments focus on bid prices rather than quality. The tendency has become more and more prevalent under electronic auction systems. It was very frustrating for me as I believe our chalk is unparalleled in quality.\n\nOverall demand for chalk has also declined. Demand for our chalk peaked in 1990. Back then, we produced 90 million sticks of chalk a year. Just before the closure of business, our annual output was 45 million sticks, half the peak level. One of the reasons for the plunge in demand is, as it is often pointed out, a shift from the blackboard to the whiteboard.\n\nFurthermore, these days there is a much more diverse range of teaching tools available. Students study with tablet computers in some classes. In my opinion, a blackboard and chalk is better than a whiteboard and marker. The main material of chalk is calcium carbonate, typically from oyster shells. So chalk is more environmentally friendly, I think.\n\nPassing on the baton\n\nSince we decided to close, we have thought about how to do it without causing customers trouble.\n\nAt first, we considered selling the whole company, enabling the Hagoromo brand to survive and helping overall chalk sales. But we could not find the right deal for the company.\n\nAnother hurdle involved machinery. Manufacturers do not produce machines for making chalk. We had to do that ourselves. I developed the production facilities by trial and error with a managing director who retired a while ago. For creating the materials for chalk, we modified a machine for mixing flour. For molding the sticks of chalk, we tweaked a machine for making roof tiles.\n\nThe machines, which we continued to modify over more than 20 years, felt like our children. We looked for buyers of the three machines, even if nobody was willing to take on the whole company.\n\nA nearby stationery maker came forward to buy one of the machines. Its mainstay product is blackboards, but it is now putting more emphasis on chalk. The company was kind enough to agree to give our employees the choice of transferring there.\n\nThe remaining two machines will be shipped to South Korea. We did a lot of business with South Korean customers. A cram school teacher in South Korea, who heard about the quality of our chalk, launched a business importing it. Our closure baffled the importer, but we agreed to transfer two of our machines to the buyer.\n\nThere is more to making our chalk than just the machines though. A precise ration of seven materials is mixed to ensure our chalk writes well and does not break easily. The recipe is optimized for our plant, so fine-tuning is needed for use overseas. I plan to visit South Korea and teach my know-how to the person who bought the machines.\n\nI'm sad that I have been forced to close down my company. But I am pleased I have been able to contribute to education by providing high-quality chalk over the last 50 years.\n\nAs told to Nikkei Business by Hagoromo's last president, Takayasu Watanabe."}

The term \"appeal\" applies both to an appeal authorized by statute and the writ of error guaranteed by Section 21 of Article I of the Constitution. The objective of these rules is to provide the same procedure for appeals and writs of error. Historically, the review authorized by a writ of error was limited to questions of law, while both the law and the facts could be reviewed on appeal. The Wisconsin Supreme Court does not distinguish between its power in appeals and in writs of error.

This often resulted in a party with interests identical to the appellant being labeled a respondent, while two parties opposed to each other were both labeled respondents.

Emergence was my biggest design project to date and I wanted to share how we allow players to become a permanent part of the game by creating their own custom map and thematic backstory.\n\nIn Emergence, players are a member of the majority A.I. team or the minority Human team. Players must traverse the city collecting data, as they look to gain knowledge for their team and identify the secret humans among them. With the city being a main factor in replay ability, we know we wanted to include custom ideas that would change the feeling of the game each time we replayed it.\n\nWith Emergence, an early design idea was to create a hexagonal game-board, much like many other games (such as the Settlers of Catan ), that would allow players to re-arrange a city layout. Not only does this drastically add to replay-ability but it gives players a sense of ownership\u2014which we thought played well with the social aspect of the game. Players can create cities with specific strategies based on the layout: choke-points, specifically placed data compilers, small pockets of rare resources, narrow passages ripe for conflict, all of these would create a different experience each time they play. We also quickly realized that resource collection (one main aspect of the game) would benefit from a hex-based map that gave players more movement options. Alongside the mechanics, we decided that we wanted to create a game with the theme and backstory that matched those mechanics (Evolution is a great example). We figured a game that players could contribute toward strategically and creatively would be something they were vested in. By flushing out the dystopic A.I. vs Humanity theme, custom cities weren't merely player-created maps but, instead, became something integral to the story behind the game. Testing labs now underground tombs, mutated forests now riddled with valuable bio-data, manmade monuments turned resistance strongholds\u2014by giving players a context, we would hopefully give them some inspiration to participate.\n\nAnd that is when we came to our City Database idea. After some play-throughs at a local game store, we realized people were interested in creating a map of their own. So we decided we would create a space on our website for people to contribute their city designs along with a backstory. It was a way for players to form a community around the game and really take their sense of ownership to a higher level. Their creation and story could be out there for the world to see\u2026 and play! What's especially cool about the Database is it allows us, as the creators, to let the people be heard (aka sit back and be lazy). While we still enjoy creating maps of our own (which can also be found in the Database), it's even better to see what the fans of Emergence have come up with. Plus, we like to give our fans some shine. What better way to start a game night by exploring a city (with a backstory) you can tell your friends that you personally created?\n\nSo far, we've been slowly receiving submissions from all over the world, most of which we try to play test among our design-team before we post to the Database. We do encourage people to at least play the game a few times before jumping into city-creation as people will quickly find how tough it can be to make a balanced, playable map. And if you just want to make a city shaped like your sister's head\u2026that's cool too.\n\n\nCheck out the database here."}

It was groundbreaking for its treatment of gender, depicting a state in which the advances of feminism have been comprehensively destroyed.

That Prophet is going to tell us why.\" Admiral Terrence Hood\n\nNew Mombasa was a major port city and industrial center on Mombasa Island in south Kenya, in the East African Protectorate on Earth. On the mouth of the river north of the island is the New Mombasa Orbital Elevator, a dominant feature of the city skyline. Old Mombasa is located on the mainland north and south of the island. Like Earth's other tether cities, New Mombasa's infrastructure was managed with the help of a second generation \"dumb\" AI, the Superintendent.[1] It was the main target of the initial Covenant attack during the Battle of Earth.[2] The city was invaded, occupied, and destroyed in the course of the conflict.\n\nContents show]\n\nHistory Edit\n\nMombasa Edit\n\nMombasa had always been an important port of the Indian Ocean trade routes and was captured and recaptured countless times by a variety of powers including Portugal, the United Kingdom, and various Arab forces. This violent history led to its Swahili nickname \"Kisiwa Cha Mvita,\" or \"Island of War.\" The city became part of the independent nation of Kenya in the 20th century. During this era, Mombasa became a tourist destination, boasting numerous resorts and clean, white beaches. It was also important as a port city, connecting East Africa to the Indian Ocean.\n\nFormation of New Mombasa Edit\n\nIn 2302, due to its economic stability and prominent location, New Mombasa\u2014at that time the world's busiest sea port\u2014was chosen to be Earth's first Space Elevator city. The elevator transformed the city; New Mombasa became one of the most important cities on Earth.[3]\n\nOver the next eleven years the city experienced explosive growth, but nothing compared to what followed. The city grew out as well as up, its urban sprawl unequaled throughout the continent.[4] An influx of trade, citizens, and jobs drastically changed the landscape of the city. Within a century, older housing and hotels on Mombasa Island were replaced with vast industrial complexes and gleaming office towers.[1]\n\nMombasa would change dramatically with the arrival of the interstellar era. By 2430, New Mombasa had absorbed the entire island and many of the surrounding towns, which became overrun by residents of Mombasa. The switch of name was never official, and though many of the neighborhoods within direct line of sight to the Mombasa Tether still distributed newspapers and chatter directories under their previous names, all municipalities within a 74-kilometer radius of the island became referred to as \"Old Mombasa.\"[4]\n\nBy the 26th century the city was a dynamic, cosmopolitan metropolis, boasting such amenities as a mile-long suspension bridge,[2][5] a highly efficient MagLev Train system, an automatic highway network, a large police department, and large-scale recreational areas.[1]\n\nThe majority of New Mombasa is divided into numbered, symmetrical sectors to limit human casualties and property damage, should disaster befall the Orbital Elevator.[6] Some districts such as Mbaraki, Kizingo or Kikowani still retain their original names. The original names are often seen in the names of streets or train stations, for example. Some of the districts' names have changed, albeit slightly; areas originally referred to as Tangana and Liwatoni are now referred to as Tanaga and Liwitoni, respectively. The locations of some districts have changed as well. This is the case with most of the districts on the southern side of the island, where the sea has claimed large areas of land.[7]\n\nThe Covenant Invasion Edit\n\nMain article: Battle of Mombasa\n\nOn October 20th, 2552, a small fleet of Covenant capital ships exited Slipspace just off of Earth's defensive network. During the ensuing battle, a Covenant Assault Carrier breached the orbital fortifications and made its way to the surface.[8] The ship, which carried the Covenant Hierarch known as the High Prophet of Regret, took position over New Mombasa, deploying troops and vehicles which occupied the city. The city's civilians either evacuated, took shelter, or were killed. In Old Mombasa, announcements in Swahili were broadcast over a public address system. These propagandist announcements encouraged New Mombasa's citizens to fight against the invading \"alien zealots,\" even though there was very little truth to these announcements as they were only intended to increase morale of those that still remained after most of the city evacuated .[9]\n\nLater that day, Master Chief Petty Officer John-117 was deployed into Old Mombasa to assist UNSC forces to liberate the city from the Covenant.

Both the donor and recipient liver segments will grow to normal size in a few weeks to months.\n\nThe donor, who may be a blood relative, spouse, or friend, will have extensive medical and psychological evaluations to ensure the lowest possible risk.

The donor's heart is still beating, but the brain has stopped functioning. Such a person is considered legally dead, because his or her brain has permanently and irreversibly stopped working. At this point, the donor is usually in an intensive-care unit.\n\nThe identity of a deceased donor and circumstances surrounding the person's death are kept confidential.\n\nScreening for Liver Transplant Donors\n\nHospitals will evaluate all potential liver transplant donors for evidence of liver disease, alcohol or drug abuse, cancer, or infection.

Whether this iteration of the roster would operate at that level if given the whole year is probably debatable, but as Mike Babcock has even alluded to recently, you have to be careful about buying too much into this kind of short-term success we've seen in the last week or so.\n\nBut even with all that in mind, we can still take look at some of these kids \u2013 a few now approaching the 15-game mark \u2013 to see how they've been performing to date, both production-wise and in terms of pushing play in the right direction. As we all know, these waves can, in fact, die, so it's good to look at who's been for real.\n\nPerhaps the best story of this Leafs youth movement since the deadline is that of Connor Carrick. When Toronto pulled the trigger on the Winnik trade last month, most of the early response was \"Yes, another draft pick\", referring to the second-rounder they picked up, but we then quickly learned that the Leafs were pretty high on Carrick and pushed to have him in the deal. He was no throw-in.\n\nA glance at Carrick's career numbers at first probably suggested to many of us he's a project-type prospect, as he's plugged away for most of the last two years at the AHL level after breaking in with the Capitals in 2013. And as we've come to learn with someone like T.J. Brennan, even with strong offensive numbers, breaking out of the AHL can be impossible for some, especially defencemen. But that's more of a cautionary tale, and considering Carrick is still a youngster, his future is obviously more wide open. He's actually a month younger than Morgan Rielly.\n\nConsidering all of this, it's been somewhat surprising to see Carrick get such a good look with the big club right away. But the looks of things early on, it was the right call.\n\nNow that we've had some time to evaluate the trade, it seems the Leafs were smart to key in on Carrick, as he was sort of a victim of circumstance with the Caps, a team in prime contention and loaded with depth on the blue-line for the long term. With a rebuilding team in Toronto he can immediately factor into their plans, and so far he's shown why with Babcock and his crew giving him plenty of opportunity already.\n\nIn his audition with the Leafs (that will take him through the rest of the schedule), Carrick has already nabbed a pair of goals and assists through twelve games. While those obviously aren't eye-popping numbers, it's still an impressive 27-point pace over an entire schedule for a guy who's tasked with about 15-16 minutes per night.\n\nCarrick's underlying numbers have been strong as well, as he's been clipping along at 55% in terms of score-adjusted Corsi For, also good for +2.3% relative to his teammates when he isn't out there. Keep in mind he's spent the majority of his time at even-strength alongside Gardiner, perhaps the Leafs' best play-driver, but his numbers overall have looked fine.\n\nAgain, it's early, and these numbers are through 15 games this season (including three with the Capitals), but it's clear so far that Carrick is no anchor, or at least he hasn't shown to be yet. At the very least, it's hard to say he isn't a strong upgrade on the blue-line compared someone like Roman Polak, a player who has almost zero offensive upside and carries the unfortunate tag of \"defensive defenceman\" (usually just a nicer name for someone who gets hemmed in their own zone all night). Carrick has some nice puck skills, and as his experience in the NHL grows, his reads and overall offensive instincts should only get better.\n\nGiven where the Capitals and Leafs are in terms of contention and organizational depth, the deal that sent Carrick to Toronto last month should be looked upon as a move that made sense for both clubs. And who knows, maybe Lamoriello finds another way to add to the defence corps and push him down the lineup before next season. But for now, management, the coaching staff, and fans alike should all be pleased with how he's turned out so far given his place on the roster.\n\nNumbers from Corsica.Hockey and Hockey-Reference."}

The rest was in India and Russia or ex-Soviet states (indeed, the one I deal with was almost exclusively coming from Russia). Then China decided that they would limit exports from that nation. The declared reason was environmental: it is indeed a messy business. The general assumption was that the reason was rather different. They limited exports of the raw materials but not of anything made from them. Neodymium for example, had an export limit (and serious export taxes) slapped on it, but FeNdB magnets, made from neodymium could be exported without limits or taxes. So we all assumed that the intention was to attract the manufacturing to China and thus increase the amount of value added in that country.\n\nSo, what actually happened? Well, just what people like me, those with more than a passing acquaintance with rare earths and free markets said would happen (indeed, I said it here in Foreign Policy). Mines outside China began to open up, exploration for new mines outside China surged (at one point there were more than 400 such projects going on) and manufacturers started to consider whether they really, really, needed to use rare earths or whether something else would do. Supply went up and demand went down in other words. Thus was the Chinese monopoly broken and prices fell back.\n\nAll of which teaches us something useful about monopolies. Where a monopoly is contestable we don't in fact have to worry about it very much. China was selling us all of the rare earths we wanted, at prices we were happy to pay, for decades. So, they had a monopoly? So what? As soon as they actually tried to take advantage of that monopoly then it all fell apart for them. They actually, by attempting to restrict supply, managed to call into being their own competition.\n\nThis has applications in other ares of current concern of course. For example, the European Union claims that Google is misusing its dominance in search. But while Google certainly is dominant in search this is a contestable monopoly. As soon as Google starts to throw its weight around to the detriment of consumers then consumers will go off and use one of the myriad of alternatives. And new alternatives will arrive as well.\n\nWhere monopolies are natural ones (perhaps because of network effects) or backed by government licence or regulation the situation is different, but a contestable monopoly can almost certainly be left alone.

{"id": 259523, "ended": true, "length": 874, "text": "We often get asked what people can do to start capoeira. The answer of course is to get to class as soon as possible! However, often people have a time gap before they can begin training, and it's for those people that I'm writing this post.\n\nA\u00fa\n\nFirstly, you're likely to encounter many movements you've never done before. This can feel uncomfortable, but don't worry, it's a normal response! To minimise your discomfort though it's a good idea to at least start to familiarise yourself with some of these movements. The most obvious one is cartwheels (or as we call it \"A\u00fa\", which sounds a little like \"Awoo\"). Unless you're a dancer or gymnast you may never have done these, so put your hands on the ground and try hopping across from one leg to the other. Make sure you try both directions, as it's likely that you'll find one side more difficult. Don't worry about making your a\u00fa perfect, your teacher will do help you with that, just get comfortable having some weight on your hands.\n\nAdvanced A\u00fa\n\nIf you are comfortable with a\u00fa and/or handstands (\"bananeiras\") then try doing them in a capoeira style - instead of looking at the floor put your head between your arms and try and look at something in front of you. This will be very helpful later on when you can see what your partner is doing.\n\nGinga\n\nThe next movement to familiarise yourself with is the ginga. This may be a controversial pick, but in my opinion being a little familiar with the movement helps to free up your brain when your teacher shows you how to do it \"right\", and that outweighs any bad habits you may pick up by trying it out. Depending on your group and style of capoeira the ginga may be rigidly defined or a completely free way to express yourself (or somewhere in the middle).\n\nGinga means \"sway\", and it's the distinctive, basic side-to-side movement of capoeira. There are a lot of terrible how-to videos out there, so I found this one after a short search and it shows most of the basic features: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbUxXJKitS4\n\nSquats and Lunges\n\nCapoeira works your whole body very well, but it is especially intense on the legs. You can get some advantage by practicing squats and lunges as deeply as you can: squat right down until you're practically sitting on the floor or lunge forwards (or backwards) until your knee touches. Be careful doing this if you have any knee injuries, you may need some help from someone knowledgable to correct your form. Even if you have strong legs from running or other sports you may find that the large range of motion here works parts of your muscles that you aren't used to.\n\nGround Work\n\nPut your hands on the floor and go for a walk like a monkey, or a cat, or a crocodile. Try leaving your feet in one place and walking your hands around you in a circle. See if you can do a bridge. Play! This will get you used to moving on the floor as well as working many useful muscles.\n\nFinally\n\nThe last piece of advice I can give is to get excited about your first class! Have a look at some capoeira videos online. There are thousands and they represent so many different levels of skill and styles of play. You won't be able to do everything you see on these videos straight away, but with enough work and a good teacher you will get further than you can believe right now. Things you can't dream of doing right now will become easy. The only guarantee is that there will always be some amazing movement or skill to learn, something new to train. Capoeira doesn't run out. It's an amazing thing and I can't wait to meet you in the roda some day.\n\nOf course, if you'd like to start training capoeira in Perth we'd love to have you, check our website for our class schedule!"}

USA TODAY Sports\n\nHope Solo is scheduled to start for the U.S. women when they play Sweden on Friday. (Photo: Bruce Fedyck, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nU.S. goalkeeper Hope Solo, soccer's Ray Rice without the video, will be on the field Friday in Winnipeg when the U.S. soccer team plays its second game of the 2015 Women's World Cup.\n\nShe shouldn't be.\n\nThe powerful, 5-9, 150-pound veteran, charged nearly a year ago with beating her half-sister and nephew in an ongoing case that has not been resolved, should have been suspended by U.S. Soccer right then.\n\nBecause the sport's leaders did nothing at the time, they should do it now. They won't, of course, because Solo is just too valuable to the team when it matters most, in the vitally important games being played in the highest profile and most prestigious tournament in the world.\n\nWhat a statement that is: The renowned U.S. women's national soccer team, which has historically stood for what is best in sports, and the best of us, is now protecting -- even promoting -- an alleged domestic abuser.\n\nJust nine months after our nation embarked on a conversation about the horrors of domestic violence, a topic that carries on to this day in the NFL and throughout society, U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati and the federation's other leaders continue to fail to take domestic abuse by a woman seriously.\n\nBy doing nothing when the issue first arose, Gulati ensured that it would come to a head at the worst possible time: during the Women's World Cup, as the U.S. prepares to play Sweden in the second game of group play.\n\nThat it has. On Thursday afternoon, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., released a letter he sent to Gulati, calling for U.S. Soccer to \"conduct a thorough investigation into this incident.\n\n\"In the interim,\" Blumenthal wrote, \"I urge U.S. Soccer to reconsider Hope Solo's position as an active member of Team USA. As boys and girls tune in to Friday's game, watching the women on TV as role models, it sends exactly the wrong message to start Hope Solo at goal.\"\n\nBlumenthal, who was outspoken in his criticism of the NFL's handling of the Rice incident last year, told me in a phone interview Thursday afternoon that U.S. Soccer's lack of action was troubling.\n\n\"It's the attitude that is most offensive here in my view,\" he said. \"This is a profoundly important issue of domestic violence that U.S. Soccer has an obligation to at least review and investigate, which it so far really has declined to do.\"\n\nSolo was arrested last June and charged with punching her 17-year-old nephew in the face and tackling him during an argument at Solo's half-sister's Kirkland, Wash., home. The teen's mother told ESPN that Solo \"grabbed him by the head and she kept slamming him into the cement over and over again.\" When she tried to intervene, Solo allegedly attacked her as well.\n\nAccording to police reports obtained by the Seattle Times and ESPN, when officers arrived on the scene, the nephew's T-shirt was torn and he had scratch marks on his arms and a bleeding cut on his ear.\n\nSolo pleaded not guilty to two counts of misdemeanor domestic violence. Her case was originally dismissed on procedural grounds, but prosecutors have filed an appeal and arguments are set to begin July 13, according to ESPN.\n\nThe U.S. soccer team and its supporters will no doubt blame Blumenthal and the news media for creating this controversy at the worst possible time, but 100% of the blame for this debacle should fall at the feet of Gulati, who has never taken the Solo news seriously enough.\n\nGulati and U.S. Soccer were shown the way by the NFL after the Rice elevator video surfaced on Sept. 8, 2014. They failed to take it. The NFL immediately suspended its abusers, alleged and real. U.S. Soccer did no such thing.\n\nIn fact, Teresa Obert, Solo's half sister, told ESPN that neither she nor her son was contacted by U.S. Soccer.\n\n(As a comparison, the WNBA certainly got the message. It suspended both Brittney Griner and Glory Johnson for seven games each after their domestic violence arrests in April.)\n\nWhat an irony this is: Gulati, the man who has been so vocal in voicing his concern for transparency and modernity in corrupt-to-the-core FIFA, blundering so badly when given the chance to take a stand with the nation's most beloved and iconic women's team -- on an issue that is so"}

Andrew Cuomo praised law enforcement agencies and expressed gratitude the incident was not as life threatening as it could have been, given the time of the incident at the busy transportation node.\n\nThe Port Authority bus terminal was closed after the incident, but reopened about two hours later.

The central rally in the north of the Strip was reportedly attended by nearly 100,000.[1] The anniversary celebrations also included a large military parade by Hamas' military wing, the 'Izz Al-Din Al-Qassam Brigades.[2]\n\nSenior Hamas officials who spoke at the marches and rallies stressed that the movement would never recognize the Zionist entity or be satisfied with a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders, and called for continuing on the path of resistance and jihad until all of Palestine, from the river to the sea, is liberated. Al-Qassam Brigades spokesman Abu 'Ubaida thanked Iran for providing Hamas with funds, weapons and missiles and thus helping it to build its army, with its many advanced units. He also declared that Hamas would soon bring about the release of Palestinian prisoners through prisoner-exchange deals.\n\nAt the same time, the speakers warned of an impending \"explosion\" if Gaza does not receive the recovery funds it was promised. They did not spare the Palestinian Authority (PA) and its leaders from their criticism, calling them \"traitors\" and urging the people of the West Bank to rise up against them.[3]\n\nIt should be noted that Hamas political bureau head Khaled Mash'al was conspicuous in his absence at the anniversary celebrations, whereas senior officials Mahmoud Al-Zahhar and Al-Qassam Brigades spokesman Abu 'Ubaida were conspicuously involved and publicly participating.

Palestine stretches from the Egyptian border in the south to Lebanon in the north, and from Jordan in the east to the Mediterranean sea in the west, and we will never recognize anything less than this.\" He added: \"If part of our land is liberated, we will establish our state in that part without relinquishing even an inch of the rest. Just as we liberated Gaza and established a genuine administration in it, [with] an army and security apparatuses that defend us, rather than the Israeli enemy [unlike those of the PA], we will do the same in the West Bank, as a prelude to attaining all of Palestine.\"\n\nAl-Zahhar called to grant freedom of action to the people in the West Bank, \"who invent means of resistance that the occupation never imagined, such as vehicular [attacks] and stabbings.\" He also harshly attacked the PA and its president, accusing them of treason against the Palestinian people, saying: \"The West Bank is suffering from two conflicts: [a conflict] with the Israeli enemy, which is directing its weapons at its face, and [another conflict] with the PA, which is stabbing it in the back while purporting to govern Palestine... Al-Zahhar called on the people of the West Bank to \"get rid of the traitors first, so that we can get rid of the occupation.\" He also urged Fatah \"to become real partners in the liberation of Palestine, and [steer] clear of [intra-Palestinian] squabbling.\"[6]\n\n\nMahmoud Al-Zahhar speaking at the rally (Alresalah.ps.

They even believe he could defeat her in the nation's first nominating contest there. The enthusiasm Sanders has generated has called into question Clinton's early strategy of focusing on a listening tour of small groups and wooing big donors in private settings, the Times writes. \"We are worried about him, sure. He will be a serious force for the campaign, and I don't think that will diminish,\" said Jennifer Palmieri, the Clinton campaign's communications director, on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" on Monday.\n\nCarson's cash: Before Republican presidential hopeful Ben Carson was vying for votes from members of Christian organizations, he was charging them tens of thousands of dollars for speeches. As Politico writes, Carson brought in nearly $2 million delivering inspirational speeches to faith-based groups including Christian high schools and pregnancy centers in 2014. A Politico analysis of his financial disclosure form showed that four of his five most lucrative speeches were at such Christian venues. His speaking fees varied widely, from $12,320 to $48,500, according to the disclosures.\n\nThe next liberal cause: The Washington Post's Greg Sargent writes that Senate Democrats will soon roll out a new universal pre-kindergarten proposal. If it gets a vote, he says, it will put members of both parties on the record as to whether they support national action to dramatically expand the availability of child care to poor and working families. The proposal could be paid for by reining in corporate tax breaks, according to the Democrats. Specifically, the program would be funded by scaling back corporate \"inversions,\" in which companies declare their U.S. operations are owned by a subsidiary abroad. That results in profits being shifted to places where they are taxed at lower rates.\n\nTrump workers talk: Donald Trump's recent comments about drug dealers and rapists crossing into the U.S. from Mexico aren't sitting well with some of the workers building a new Trump hotel in downtown Washington. The Washington Post says the job site is laden with tension in the wake of Trump's remarks, since it's Latin American immigrants who are doing the bulk of the work. The Post, in fact, says Trump's company may be relying on some undocumented workers to finish the $200 million hotel, which will sit five blocks from the White House. A Trump spokeswoman said the company and its contractors follow all applicable laws.

Many of Texas Tech's top recruits will be in town to cheer on the Red Raiders and explore the great University of Texas Tech. Here is a list of some recruits that are attending and what could possibly influence them to pick the Red Raiders:\n\nThe Commits\n\nJarrett Stidham - Quarterback (Stephenville HS, Stephenville, TX)\n\nHeight Weight 40 time Vertical Power Throw Ratings 6'3\" 185 lbs 4.57 (4.38 shuttle) 31.1 32.5 98 (247), 86 (ESPN), 6.0 (Rivals), 5-star (Scout)\n\nStidham visits Lubbock once again this weekend, the 3rd time this season. This visit is his most important one yet. That is because Stidham has 3 possible receiver targets coming into Lubbock (two that are in the Top 150) and a Top 100 O-linemen from the 2017 class. While Kingsbury and company are doing their job on the field, Stidham can talk to these recruits throughout the game and convince them that they need to be Red Raiders. What's more appealing than the Top QB in the nation convincing you to catch passes from you? Having Stidham in ear of the recruits throughout the game will be a huge recruiting tool for the Red Raiders\n\nBreiden Fehoko - Defensive Tackle (Farrington HS, Honolulu, HI)\n\nHeight Weight Shuttle Vertical Bench Ratings 6'3\" 290 lbs 4.75 24.7\" 405 lbs 97 (247), 85 (ESPN), 5.9 (Rivals), 5-star (Scout)\n\nBreiden Fehoko will take his lone official visit this weekend to Lubbock. His regular season just ended and will be taking advantage of the bye week to visit Lubbock again. There one defensive recruits attending this game (S Christian Taylor), but Jack Anderson has already expressed interest via Twitter in meeting and hanging out with Breiden Fehoko. He could also help talk to offensive recruits about joining the team. When two of the Top 50 recruits in the nation are talking to you about joining their team, people start listening. Having Fehoko there will really help with recruiting.\n\nFootball Recruits\n\nTyron Johnson - Wide Receiver (Warren Eastern HS, New Orleans, LA)\n\nHeight Weight 40 time Vertical Power Throw Ratings 6'1\" 185 lbs 4.52 (4.31 shuttle) 33\" 38' 97 (247), 88 (ESPN), 6.1 (Rivals), 4-star (Scout)\n\nAfter having to cancel his official visit to Arkansas, Tyron Johnson to finally making his trip to Lubbock this weekend. This will be his only official visit this season. He has visited Clemson (named leader two months ago), LSU, A&M and others, but the Texas Tech visit will the only visit in the last few months. Tyron Johnson will get the opportunity to talk with Jarrett Stidham, whom he talked to before at The Opening, and get familiarized with the Quarterback. A strong relationship between the two could cause Tyron Johnson to pull the trigger. On the field, Johnson would likely like to see to WRs to be involved in many clever ways. A player he might be keeping an eye on is Reginald Davis, who plays a lot like Johnson would if he were in Texas Tech's offense. Tyron Johnson could start at outside receiver (with all the switching around in recent weeks) or Marquez's position once he graduates. Hopefully Johnson will see a chance to start early. One thing that could've helped Tech is Speedy Noil's performance for Texas A&M thus far. Like Johnson, Noil was the Top Louisiana WR. He choose an Air Raid offense in A&M this winter and so far has done great in the offense. Hopefully Tyron Johnson sees that and thinks he can make the same impact for an Air Raid offense like Texas Tech.\n\nCarlos Strickland - Wide Receiver (Skyline HS, Dallas, TX)\n\nHeight Weight 40 time Vertical Power Throw Ratings 6'5\" 195 lbs 4.72 (Shuttle 4.28) 28.7\" 31' 90 (247), 82 (ESPN), 5.9 (Rivals), 4-star (Scout)\n\nCarlos Strickland will be taking his official visit to Texas Tech after talking to the Red Raiders for several months now. Ever time Carlos Strickland names a Top 5, Texas Tech is listed as one of the schools. This time around, Texas Tech was listed in his Top 4 along with Cal, UCLA and favorite TCU. He will take his official to Cal next weekend and TCU the week after that (for the Texas Tech game). Luckily for the Red Raiders, Tech will be the only school out of the four to have a Top rated QB at the game, which could help Texas Tech. Also"}

A 'retox' recipe.\"\n\nBrilliant!\n\nWhile I'm all for healthy eating, I can't help but think that the dead of winter is the worst time to fast on green juices and smoothies. San Francisco finally had a cold snap this past week and all I want to do is burrow under the covers, drink tea, eat chocolate, and watch Gilmore Girls with a cat on my toes.\n\n\nLast weekend I needed a dessert to bring to a family potluck. I had some bananas I'd bought for making smoothies and then promptly ignored in favor of piping hot chilaquiles, so I decided to try a gluten-free version of my favorite banana cream tart.\n\n\"This is ridiculous,\" I thought as I whisked butter into custard, added a shot of rum, and spread the whole thing in a chocolatey tart crust. \"Everyone's probably on a diet. No one's gonna eat this.\"\n\n\nAt my brother's house later that evening, I was elated to discover how wrong I'd been. My brother poured me a tall glass of brown sugar mint julep he'd whipped up. My sister had made a vat of sour cream garlic mashed potatoes to go with my sister-in-law's roast and green salad slathered in buttermilk dressing.\n\n\nAfter dinner, I cut the tart into tiny wedges which my family fell upon like hungry bears preparing for hibernation. Everyone went back for seconds. They ate the whole thing in a matter of minutes. I regretted not making two because I thought about it long after it was gone, and I overheard my nephew say later, a wistful look in his eye that echoed my own sentiments, \"I wish there was more pie\u2026\"\n\n\nLuckily, this tart is pretty simple to make, as far as tarts go. It starts with a press-in crust made from cocoa, buckwheat and almond flour, a bit of tapioca starch, unrefined muscobado sugar and butter. The crumbly dough gets pressed into a tart pan (no chilling or rolling necessary), quickly frozen, and baked without the need for pie weights. A smear of chocolate in the bottom shields the crust from absorbing moisture from the custard, keeping it buttery crisp like the most flavorful shortbread you've ever had.\n\n\nInto the chocolate-lined crust goes a simple butterscotch pudding (adapted from this one) flavored with vanilla bean, black rum, and muscobado sugar from Alter Eco. If we're anything alike, you'll be hard pressed not to suck down all of the warm custard as soon as it's made. But if you resist, let it cool, and spread it in the tart crust with sliced banana, you'll see how gracefully all of these flavors bring out the tropical notes in the fruit. The whole thing gets topped off with billows of whipped cream laced with more vanilla, rum and muscobado. I like to add mascarpone to make the cream a bit thicker and more stable, but you can also nix it in favor of more cream.\n\n\nWhen you stick a piece of tart in your mouth, buttery crust gives way to creamy custard and gooey bananas. The buckwheat pops out in a symphony of earth and spice, bouncing off of sweet fruit and mild cream. Buckwheat always reminds me of toasted hazelnuts mixed with chocolate and cinnamon, and this crust makes me think of Nutella. Cacao nibs on top add crunch, and the muscobado sugar gives the dessert subtle caramel notes that make it extra addictive. This is one of my all-time favorite desserts, one that I plan to make over and over again.\n\n\nTomorrow I'm going to Kabuki Springs to marinate in steam and mud masks with my niece, who's visiting from her first year of college on the East Coast. Soaking in a sauna, drinking cucumber water and hot tea while soothing music plays in the background\u2026 now that's my idea of a winter detox.\n\nWith pie for dessert, of course.\n\nThanks for reading!

With their wide selection of paddle boards to their massive online and media presence, there is no doubt that that they are the first company you find when you are introduced to the sport. One of their inflatable paddle boards has over 450 reviews on Amazon, far surpassing the next closest competitor.\n\nSo, how did Tower Paddle Boards come to rule the space? Where are Tower Paddle Boards made? And are Tower paddle boards any good? There is no shortage of questions to ask when you are planning to plop down many hundreds of dollars on a paddle board. Have no fear, in this article I hope to answer any and all questions about Tower inflatable paddle boards so that you will know exactly what to expect.\n\nAbout Tower Paddle Boards\n\nTower Paddle Boards was an idea dreamt up in the summer of 2010 by a marketer named Stephan Aarstol who saw the growing popularity of paddle boards, as well as their high prices. Stephan figured that he could cut down on the sale price of paddle boards, without sacrificing quality, by streamlining the distribution process. They don't sell in big box stores like Dick's Sporting Goods or REI. They were able to achieve quick success by pricing their product to almost half the price of other boards of the same quality.\n\nTower got a big boost of publicity (and cash) when it appeared on the popular show Shark Tank in 2012. Billionaire Mark Cuban ended up investing $150,000 dollars into Tower Paddle Boards and continues to help run the company today. That infusion of cold hard cash, as well as massive public exposure on ABC's hit show, helped rocket Tower Paddle Boards to massive success and massive market share. Tower is now one of the most successful companies that has ever appeared on Shark Tank.\n\nWhere are Tower Paddle Boards Made?\n\nChina, basically. A lot of the drop stitch fabric for the Tower inflatable paddle boards are manufactured in South Korea or Taiwan, but all of Towers' paddle boards are assembled in china as well as nearly all inflatable SUPs on the market.\n\nIf you are dead set on getting a handcrafted American paddle board then you will want to look somewhere else, and inflatable SUPs are definitely not for you.\n\nBut let's keep an open mind here. Tower is a good company that stands behind their boards and their prices are right where we want them.\n\nAbout Tower Inflatable Paddle Boards\n\nSolid paddle boards are very fun and versatile but they don't come without downsides. The hardness of a fiberglass paddle board can hurt under your feet after a few hours of supping. Fiberglass boards are also really big and can be a pain to store and to transport from place to place, especially if you are just a casual weekender or only paddle board a few times every summer. Fiberglass can also be fragile, nicks and dings can cause serious damage to a board, causing it to get waterlogged and rot. Not to mention that hard boards are\u2026well\u2026hard. Falling off your board and hitting your elbow on the way down can seriously hurt, and ruin an otherwise peaceful and relaxing sport.\n\nFortunately there is a solution to all of these problems and it's called the inflatable paddle board or iSUP.\n\nTower inflatable paddle boards are lightweight, durable, portable and when compared to hardboards, a relatively cheap paddle board option.\n\nThe skin of the Tower inflatable paddle boards are multiple layers thick and are made of an extremely durable military grade PVC fabric called Hypalon. They're basically made of the same material that white water rafts are made from. This durability means that you can deal these boards some serious abuse, including running over them with a truck or throwing them off a building. Tower inflatable paddle boards are up to nearly any abuse that a couple of 14 year old boys can throw at them. The sun can wash out the colors over time and you should store your inflatable sup in a dry area out of direct sunlight. It's not something you need to obsess over though. Leaving the board on the beach for the day is fine.\n\nAfter you have fully inflated your board it shouldn't lose much air. The most common cause of air loss is not tightening the valve enough. If your board is losing air, try and tighten your valve a bit more and that should take care of it. If that doesn't fix the problem, Tower Paddle Boards has excellent customer service that you should reach out to and a very generous 2 year warranty.\n\nAnother advantage is that Tower inflatable SUPs are soft. Your feet and knees will thank you for for choosing an iSUP over a hard board. Inflatable paddle boards are also great for yoga because their soft surface is easier on your elbows, head, knees, and just about any body part that contacts the board.\n\nDon't think that"}

A few notes: This is obviously not a transcript, but just the ppt slides. I've timed myself going through them with the commentary I want to add, and it takes about 30 minutes to go through it.\n\nIt is subject to change between now and San Japan. If you have any suggestions/corrections, PLEASE add them! Edit: Reorganized the slides to take up less space on dash.\n\nI disagree with so much of this. I am getting fed up with Western audiences in general but especially with anime (since I am Japanese). This is culturally imperialist, white feminist drivel (but it's not only white women that do this) and it reeks of hypocrisy - you can't preach this kind of stuff when the West is also sexist. If y ou are not Japanese then you don't have any right to decide which parts of our media are definitely sexist or feminist. I can't believe you were t rying to \"educate\" people on this topic at a god damn panel.\n\nHell, t he Western market contributes to less than 1% of the anime industry and Westerners are probably one of the worst things for the industry. The majority of them practise piracy and don't spend a cent yet continue to complain about the quality of anime, demand that studios produce xyz and even whine when their free fansubs aren't released on express. I once saw some people on a Hourou Musuko post recommending that everyone use KissAnime instead of Crunchyroll because Crunchyroll didn't have a large selection (since it was legal and was a pay-to-use service created to support anime producers)\u2026just how spoiled are you people?\n\nThere is no such genre called \"Girl Coming of Age\" and the \"Magical Girl\" genre was a huge contributing factor to the popularisation of moe (fanservice through infantilsation). Funny how you have Madoka and Sora no Woto listed as \"feminist series\" when they are both moe shows aimed towards adult males. Many people were discussing how Madoka was pretentious lolicon but no one on tumblr thought about the social context until Urobuchi's interview spread over to tumblr. Misty/Kasumi from Pokemon is still sexualised, she was often used for fanservice scenes (which may not have appeared in the English dubbed versions) and Pokemon's primary demographic is young males. This kind of \"innocent fanservice\" is very common among kodomo anime but again, you won't realise anything without being raised in the culture.\n\nI'm also rolling my eyes pretty hard at how you want anime to subvert gender roles but also believe anime is feminist for presenting girliness as a strength. Japan is a very conservative society and girls being encouraged to be feminine through children's TV is a way of keeping gender conformity. That's not a feminist message. There is so much pressure in Japanese society to follow these gender roles. A tomboy is seen as lacking in submissiveness and feminine charm and will often be told in her life that she will be unworthy of marriage and will never be a \"real woman\".\n\nThe standard for a \"girly girl\" is much higher in Japan and girls that don't reach it are viewed as \"manly\" since masculinity is the default. This was largely a result of Western imperialists threatening Japanese men (wow what a surprise) after the Meiji era. These Japanese men decided that they would have to become tougher and that they had to stop the \"feminization\" of their culture by instilling stricter roles onto the Japanese population.\n\nThis is reflected in video games such as Persona 4 where Naoto pretended to be a boy because she wasn't as feminine as society told her she should have been. She wanted to be a detective but to do that she would have to avoid being seen as a weak girl and to gain respect by posing as man. All you tumblr anime feminists went off to interpret her as a trans man and continued to piss on anyone that tried to tell you otherwise. Chihiro from Dangan Ronpa is another example of the problems with these strict gender roles. Don't project your Western values onto Japanese society.\n\nOften times tomboy may not be considered masculine from a Western perspective, and in fact very feminine instead. Many Japanese feminists are arguing for an abolition of gender roles on children's TV, they don't want presenting either masculinity or femininity as a strength. Japan is a traditionalist, homogeneous society with a deep focus on collectivism. If boys and girls were encouraged to focus on their own traits rather than doing just what their gender expected them then that would be pretty damn feminist."}

Lowry and DeRozan are one of only three backcourts averaging at least 20 points apiece.\n\nDeRozan finished with 23 in a 104-100 win over the Suns on Nov. 24, 2014, in the most recent meeting at Toronto, but did not play in a 125-109 loss in Phoenix on Jan. 4.\n\nThe Raptors have defeated three 2014-15 playoff clubs during their run, including the Los Angeles Clippers and Cleveland. Tied for the fewest home games among Eastern Conference teams, they can take advantage of a favorable stretch with seven of the next eight coming at Air Canada Centre.\n\nPhoenix (7-9) makes its first stop on a five-game trip after allowing season highs in points, field-goal percentage (56.8) and 3-point percentage (57.9) in Friday's 135-116 loss to Golden State. The Suns let the Warriors hit 22 of 38 from beyond the arc, falling one shy of the NBA record for 3s.\n\n\"We had defensive breakdowns with the flow of the game,\" said T.J. Warren, who had a career-high 28 points. \"That's part of basketball. We just have to keep playing hard through the adversity.\"\n\nThe Suns haven't been able to do that during their season-high losing streak, allowing an average of 118.8 points on 51.4 percent shooting - including 47.3 from beyond the arc.\n\nMaking matters worse, Chandler, their primary rim protector and leading rebounder with 8.8 per game, is doubtful after straining his right hamstring in the first quarter Friday.\n\nAt least Phoenix won't have to worry about Jonas Valanciunas, who totaled 48 points and 21 rebounds in last season's series. The 7-footer is expected to miss six weeks with a broken left hand.\n\nBrandon Knight and Eric Bledsoe each scored 21 on a combined 18-of-32 shooting against the Warriors. They're the league's only backcourt averaging 21 points or more each.\n\n\"You've got to pick your poison,\" Bledsoe, who totaled 45 points versus Toronto last season, told the team's official website. \"Is it going to be me or Brandon?\"\n\nSince winning 14 in a row in the series, the Suns have lost four of the past seven meetings.\n\nCopyright 2015 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

That didn't last very long. We've seen clips of an interview with Lucas over the last couple of weeks where he began to explain why the breakdown occurred. Now the full interview has been released, and we have even more of George Lucas being obviously unhappy with the direction that Disney has taken his beloved Star Wars For better or worse, it's difficult to argue now that The Force Awakens went back to the well when it came to a lot of the aspects of the movie. They wanted to recapture the love that fans had for the original film, and so they used it as a template for what they were going to do with the new one. For George Lucas, this was the problem, as he tells Charlie Rose , because he doesn't see the point in making a movie if you're not going to do something new.It's true that these days it seems nearly every movie in the theater is either a reboot or a sequel, or at least based on some previously existing material.

{"id": 259547, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Joe Chrisp is a PhD student at the IPR. His doctoral research is on the feasibility of a universal basic income\n\nDespite the Conservative Party still winning the most seats, the General Election was undoubtedly a seismic event that shook the foundations of how many people understand politics. Yet, there are almost as many people that claim to have the answer to the GE puzzle as there were people who claimed it was a foregone conclusion. By explaining the result people are also attempting to map out a path forwards and predict what it means for politics in the future. With the onward march of basic income worldwide, at least in terms of attention, it is interesting to consider what the election may mean for the future of basic income in the UK. How should advocates view the election result in respect to the political feasibility of basic income?\n\nThe Politics of Hope\n\nIs anything possible? The most obvious lesson of the election that should embolden basic income advocates is that the rules of politics as we know it can be flouted. While the EU referendum and the election of Donald Trump to the White House both signalled that politics was changing, most of the political class assumed that anti-establishment politics from the Left was unlikely to have the same appeal. The received wisdom was that due to the overestimation of Labour's vote share in every election since 1983, even the late surge in the polls was unlikely to mean anything other than a comfortable Conservative majority. The fact that a variety of electoral red lines, from economic stimulus to national security, seemed to matter less than expected inevitably opens up the political debate. Is it possible that the public could support universal, unconditional benefits after all? Or at least vote for a party that promised them?\n\nOf course, the causes of Labour's success are near impossible to disentangle and the Conservatives' dreadful campaign should not be ignored. Yet, it would be difficult to argue that big and bold policy proposals in the manifesto, such as abolishing tuition fees, did not have a sizeable impact on Labour's election result. Committing to \u00a348 billion of spending did not have the expected effect on Labour's credibility, and the apparent failure of the 'magic money tree' narrative to deter voters should spell hope for any policy of expansion. The most recent British Social Attitudes Report suggests that support for tax and spend policies is growing.[1] The survey suggests that nearly half the population would support raising tax to fund increased state spending. This was higher than the proportion that prefer the status quo for the first time since 2006. If this election truly marks the end of austerity, it may unlock the funds and the political ambition to launch a new transformative agenda to reshape the welfare state. The return of universalism to the heart of the Labour project \u2013 whether on university fees, school meals or in regards to pensions and the winter fuel allowance \u2013 also may bode well for basic income or the principles behind it.\n\nThe ability of the Labour leadership to bypass most of the party and media's obvious scepticism and sell the manifesto directly to the public is also likely to give hope to advocates that think basic income would be popular if only there was a more prominent sponsor. The increasing influence of new media sources, whatever their reliability, can only help more leftfield policy proposals such as basic income get on the agenda. Advocates may feel that a Select Committee snub is not quite as grave as it might have been in the past[2]. That young people seem to be engaged in politics again also gives credence to the idea that their apathy was based on what was on offer rather than innate disinterest. Basic income could perhaps be part of a wider package to enthuse younger voters back into the fold. From polling on basic income, pensioners (or those who have already secured their own basic income) are generally found to be among the most consistent opponents.[3] Hence, the possibility that the pensioner bloc may be loosening its stranglehold on British electoral politics can only be seen as good news for advocates. The BSA report also suggests that the extent to which the public more broadly view pensioners as deserving of extra funding is on the wane. For the first time in more than 30 years, pensions were found not to be the public's main priority for extra spending on benefits.\n\nAn electorate that seems more receptive to expansionary public spending and new avenues for engagement with the public give rise to the idea that the door may be opening. Can basic income attach itself to the new radical politics of hope?\n\nHarsh Reality?\n\nMost of these points are broad indicators that the wind is blowing in a direction that could allow basic income to become mainstream politics. However, zeroing in on some specifics paints quite a different picture.\n\nFirstly, whether free university and the National Education service, free school meals or increasing NHS and school budgets, the universalism of the Labour manifesto was primarily the universalism of public services. This of course does not necessarily pave the way for universal cash benefits. Telling a nurse that hasn't had"}

I always believe in myself that if I work hard, work on my techniques, train hard that I can get to the top and be the best.

Over the next 20 years, this trend will accelerate: by 2020, there will be more of these \"Nones\" than Catholics, and by 2035, they will outnumber Protestants.\n\nThe following figure shows changes since 1972 and these predictions, based on data from the General Social Survey (GSS):\n\nCredit: Allen Downey\n\nThe GSS, which surveys 1,000\u20132,000 adults in the U.S. per year, includes questions related to religious beliefs and attitudes. Regarding religious affiliation, it asks \"What is your religious preference: is it Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, some other religion, or no religion?\"\n\nIn the figure, the dark lines show the fraction of respondents in each group for each year of the survey until 2016. The shaded areas show predictions, based on a statistical model of the relationship between year of birth, age, and religion.\n\nReligious beliefs are primarily determined by the environment people grow up in, including their family life and wider social influences. Although some people change religious affiliation later in life, most do not, so changes in the population are largely due to generational replacement.\n\nWe can get a better view of generational changes if we group people by their year of birth, which captures information about the environment they grew up in, including the probability that they were raised in a religious tradition and their likely exposure to people of other religions. The following figure shows the share of people in each religious group, for birth years from 1880 to 1995:\n\nCredit: Allen Downey\n\nAmong people born before 1940, a large majority are Protestant, only 20\u201325 percent are Catholic, and very few are Nones or Others. But these numbers have changed rapidly in the last few generations: among people born since 1980, there are more Nones than Catholics, and among the youngest adults, there may already be more Nones than Protestants.\n\nHowever, this view of the data does not show the effect of age. If religious affiliation increases or decreases, on average, as people get older, this figure could be misleading.\n\nFortunately, with observations over more than 40 years, the design of the GSS makes it possible to build a statistical model that estimates the effects of birth year and age separately. Then we can use the model to generate predictions, by simulating the results of future surveys. The details of this methodology are in a longer version of this article (see links below).\n\nAre these predictions credible?\n\nSocial changes are generally unpredictable. At any point another \"Great Awakening\" could reverse these trends. But among social changes, demographic predictions are relatively safe; the events they predict have, in some sense, already happened. The people who will turn 40 years old in 2037 are turning 20 this year, and we already have data about them. The people who will turn 20 in 2037 have been or soon will be born. So these predictions will only be wrong if current teenagers are more religious than people in their 20s, or if current children are being raised in a more religious environment. But in both cases, the opposite is more likely to be true.\n\nIn fact, there are reasons to think these predictions are conservative:\n\nSurvey results like these are subject to social desirability bias, which is the tendency of respondents to shade their answers in the direction they think is more socially acceptable. To the degree that apostasy is stigmatized, we expect these reports to underestimate the number of Nones. As the visibility of nonreligious people increases, they might be more willing to be counted; in that case, the trends would go faster than predicted. The trends for Protestants and Nones have apparent points of inflection near 1990. Predictions that include earlier data are likely to underestimate future trends. If we use only data since 1990 to generate predictions, we expect the fraction of Nones to exceed 40 percent within 20 years.\n\nA longer version of this article is available from my blog, \"Probably Overthinking It.\" It applies the same methods to predict changes in other aspects of religion: belief in God, interpretation of the Bible, and confidence in the people who run religious organizations.\n\nThe data I used and all of my code are available in this Jupyter notebook."}

They were originally the equivalent of a filler villain that was just one of many warbands, seemingly made to pad out GW's Dark Vengeance set and give the Dark Angels a villain to destroy. They've since been expanded upon via a few novella, a summer campaign, and even a codex supplement. Somewhat unpopular with the fandom. Basically a World Eaters color scheme, somewhat predictable fluff, and trying to take the Red Corsairs place, who were trying to take the Black Legion's place, as the warbands on box art.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nOriginally a loyalist Chapter known as the Crimson Sabers (seriously), not much is known about their pre-Chaos history save for a few mentions dating from the Age of Apostasy. The most notable of these was an incident referred to as the Amalgamation Schism, when the fledgling Chapter's disregard for the seniority of the Dark Angels and the Blood Angels (as well as the unintentional interruption of an interrogation of one of the Fallen SOME RANDOM TRAITOR THAT WAS IN NO WAY ASSOCIATED WITH THE DARK ANGELS) during what was supposed to be a routine space hulk cleansing led it to the Chapter cutting all ties to its now-unknown founding Chapter and swear to become so Codex-adherent that even the Red Scorpions and the most stereotyped perception of the Ultramarines would think they were taking things too far. Over time, they built a reputation for being effective, but prone to bouts of paranoia and highly critical of even the most trivial faults of their allies, especially in regards to breaches of the Codex Astartes.\n\nIn 928.M41, they incurred the wrath (or maybe pleasure) of Khorne when they slaughtered a planet full of people on the Jungle World of Umidia to stop Khorne's worshippers there from summoning one of his Greater Daemons (although the most recent version of the story claims that they were duped into killing loyal citizens by a Lord of Change and its human servants and only realized that they had been tricked after they had killed everyone).\n\nAnyway, Chaos 'gifted' the marines of the Crimson Sabres with the ability to constantly hear the voices of those they had killed and to see their faces whenever they closed their eyes. As you can imagine it didn't take long to drive all of them completely barmy from this and soon madness and paranoia gripped them all. They did discover a temporary reprieve; by killing others they could drown out the sounds of their victims and give themselves a time of quiet before the voices starting to come back. They're basically marines who spent too much time in the bush and can't hack it back in the real world.\n\nTruly Khorne found the perfect way then to drive even the greatest of the Imperium's marines mad and make them join the ranks of Chaos. Only question is, why did he only use it on a single chapter? Surely it would make common sense to......oh there's my answer. Common sense and Chaos hardly skip through the grass together even on the best of days.\n\nSo the Chapter Master of the Crimson Sabres, Sevastus Kranon (who would later be called Kranon the Relentless after he fell) in desperation sent his Marines to purge the systems surrounding Umidia on the pretense that they had been corrupted too by proximity. It was during this time that the Inquisition and the High Lords of Terra suspected the Sabres were falling due to their mad slaughtering and declared them renegades. At this point Kranon's brother Sevarion attempted to protest, but was tricked into a Helbrute's shell and was promptly reduced to a bloodthirsty maniac himself. With a last shred of dignity remaining, Kranon took his men into the Eye of Terror for one last suicidal crusade to slaughter heretics instead of innocents, but this didn't work out as intended. The Sabres massacred their way through planet after planet butchering everything from cultists to Khornate berserkers and as time passed this began to affect them.

(Photo: SUBMITTED)\n\nTransgender students and their rights on public school campuses have created national debates among school officials. The West Allis-West Milwaukee District is no different.\n\nAt a workshop during the Monday, Dec. 19, school board meeting, West Allis-West Milwaukee Superintendent Marty Lexmond and others weighed in on the dilemma of providing services and protecting the safety of transgenders without intruding on the academic and extracurricular lives of the main student body.\n\nSchool districts are grappling with controversial policies that largely pertain to the use of bathrooms and locker rooms.\n\nThis school year, the district has students in at least two schools whose current gender identities differ from their biological ones. The scenario, coupled with changing cultural norms and a pending U.S. Supreme Court ruling, prompted a discussion about district policies and procedures.\n\nThe heart of the controversy is rooted in anti-discrimination language, which lays out a number of provisions, including calls on districts not to display bias against such characteristics as race, religious affiliation and sex.\n\nThe nation's top court will rule on whether the term \"sex\" encompasses gender identity, in addition to the traditional definition of biological gender. If so, districts might have to give transgender students the opportunity to use restrooms and locker rooms, if requested, based on their desired gender.\n\n\"The context comes from our principals, who are calling us (at the district office) for guidance,\" Lexmond said at the workshop.\n\n\"I'm a little uncomfortable about this, and I have to be upfront and honest with you about it. I know things have evolved. I want to be sensitive to the transgender students \u2026 but at the same time, we have to be considerate of everyone.\" Sue Sujecki, school board member\n\nSo far, West Allis-West Milwaukee has not incurred any challenges in meeting transgender students' needs during the regular school, Lexmond said, adding that appropriate accommodations have been made to give the students access to single-use restroom facilities that typically are reserved for faculty members.\n\nAlthough no formal action was taken at Monday's meeting, the board by consensus gave Lexmond the green light to proceed with current protocol. When the district learns a student is identifying by a gender different from their biological one, the district is adopting a specific plan.\n\nIn extenuating circumstances, such as a transgender student not wishing to use a private restroom, Lexmond said a closed-session meeting would be held with the school board to discuss the student's specific needs.\n\nLexmond and the board also delved into some of the complexities surrounding the issue, including student records, which must reflect the person's legal name. Depending upon the circumstance, those records could differ from the name the student identifies by in class.\n\nThe discussion carried a broad spectrum of circumstances \u2014 from students who are considering changing their identity to those who are already undergoing the transition.\n\n\"Parents are ideally involved in the process, but it's case-by-case,\" Lexmond said, noting that the district would honor a student's desire for confidentiality from parents if safety concerns arose. Those concerns, Lexmond said, would be documented.\n\nBoard members offered varied viewpoints, making the discussion a robust one.\n\n\"I'm a little uncomfortable about this, and I have to be upfront and honest with you about it,\" board member Sue Sujecki said. \"I know things have evolved. I want to be sensitive to the transgender students \u2026 but at the same time, we have to be considerate of everyone.\"\n\nFellow board member Dan Bailey said he was concerned about the policies and procedures and their fluidity as the ruling from the Supreme Court lays on the horizon.\n\n\"My main concern, however, is the safety of the (transgender) student,\" Bailey said.\n\nThis is not the first time transgender students' rights have been discussed in West Allis-West Milwaukee. Attempting to refute a previous concern, board member Pat Kerhin emphasized the district has met transgender students' needs at no additional cost to taxpayers.\n\n\"We've been able to accommodate their needs without a penny spent,\" Kerhin said.\n\nThe Supreme Court has not set a firm timetable on when it will take up transgender students' rights in public schools, though it is expected to come at some point in 2017.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://www.greenfield-westallisnow.com/story/news/local/west-allis/2016/12/20/west-allis-west-milwaukee-looks-transgender-students-rights-federal-ruling-looms/95649114/"}

[Credit: ] \u00d7\n\nEntanglement, first introduced by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen [1], and Schr\u00f6dinger [2] in 1935, can arise when two quantum systems are produced from a common source, for instance, when two particles are produced with opposite spin in a decay process. Mathematically, this means that the state of the quantum system cannot be written as a mixture of product states of its constituent subsystems. As shown in 1964 [3], such states can violate a set of relations now called Bell inequalities, implying that quantum theory exhibits a form of nonlocality. That is, entangled quantum systems behave as if they can affect each other instantaneously, even when they are extremely remote from each other. Entanglement and nonlocality are two of the main concepts studied in the quantum information sciences. Although it is immediately clear that entanglement is necessary for nonlocality, a detailed quantitative relation between these two concepts is not yet established. Writing in Physical Review Letters, Francesco Buscemi of the University of Nagoya, Japan, makes important progress in this direction [4].\n\nNowadays, entang"}

But this time the leftist populist is ahead in polls, thanks to a rise in anti-American, anti-Trump sentiment.\n\nLOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, HOST:\n\nPresident Trump's tough talk about Mexico is not helping Mexico's president. It's giving a boost to one of his opponents though, a left-wing populist candidate, as Carrie Kahn reports.\n\nCARRIE KAHN, BYLINE: Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is no newcomer to Mexico's rough-and-tumble politics. He's very well versed in appealing to Mexico's poor and working class.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nANDRES MANUEL LOPEZ OBRADOR: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nKAHN: At a recent rally in one of Mexico City's poorer suburbs, Lopez Obrador told supporters that he will end long-standing corruption in the country, return stolen riches to the poor and bring about change and make Mexico better than ever. Lopez Obrador's presidential stump speech echoes much of those of Mexico's newest nemesis to the north. He promises to bring back jobs and stand up to foreign investors. But Lopez Obrador gets the biggest applause when he goes after President Trump directly.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nLOPEZ OBRADOR: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nKAHN: \"This Donald Trump is erratic and arrogant,\" says Lopez Obrador, \"and we won't allow his wall or mistreatment of our fellow migrants in the U.S.\" His willingness to publicly berate Trump has boosted his standing in the polls. He now leads among probable presidential candidates, including those of the current ruling party, whose chances have been hurt greatly by President Enrique Pena Nieto's weak response to Trump. It's still more than a year away before Mexicans go to the polls, and Lopez Obrador hasn't officially declared his candidacy, but there is no doubt he's running. He's consistently on the campaign trail holding rallies nearly every day, including several stops this week in the U.S.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED ANNOUNCER: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nKAHN: His leftist Morena party runs nonstop radio and TV ads showing off a remade Lopez Obrador with a softer, more positive tone than past campaigns where his critics labeled him too bombastic and egotistical. Political science professor at the Colegio de Mexico, Sergio Aguayo, says Trump and Lopez Obrador have similar populist appeal.\n\nSERGIO AGUAYO: Both are rebels but of different sort. And it will be fascinating to watch the interaction among both of them.\n\nKAHN: Throughout his decades in politics, Lopez Obrador has long cast himself as a political outsider and staunch nationalist. But unlike Trump, Lopez Obrador lives a modest and austere life. As a popular mayor of Mexico City from 2000 to 2005, he famously rode around in a Nissan sedan and handed out cash to the poor and seniors. In 2006, he lost his first presidential bid by less than 1 percent, blaming massive fraud for his defeat.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting in Spanish).\n\nKAHN: Tens of thousands of supporters demanded a recount of each ballot box and vote, like this crowd chanted, while blocking Mexico City's main streets for weeks, bringing the heart of the capital to a standstill until Lopez Obrador finally conceded. Six years later, after another loss, this time by a larger margin, he once again cried foul and brought supporters out into the streets. But these days, his crowds are much smaller. Housewife Antonia Ledzma isn't deterred.\n\nANTONIA LEDZMA: (Speaking Spanish).\n\nKAHN: In an echo of many U.S. voters last year, Ledzma says Mexico is ready for a change.

In the temperate and boreal forests, their primate ancestors re-adapted to an arboreal lifestyle, while also learning to carefully read the weather of this new, harsher land. By the time humans arrived, elves were already firmly entrenched in Europe, but the two groups largely desired different lands to live in, and so early conflict was minimal.\n\nModern-Day Distribution Edit\n\nElves are found almost everywhere humans and epesi are, though of course sanctuaries are built far from large cities and industrialized areas.\n\nAlong with humans and epesi, elves crossed the land bridge into the Americas.

Their natural intuitions and long lives gave them a level of prestige in many societies, and elves often formed much or all of the priestly caste in Native American cultures in this region. Even today, they tend to be set somewhat apart, unable to shake a reputation as witch doctors and shamans whether or not an individual elf has ever studied magic in any form.\n\nSanctuaries Edit\n\nBy far the most common elven lifestyle in Eurasia and Africa, Sanctuaries are isolated, self-sufficient communities of elves often placed far from any other humanoid settlement. They may trade for a few luxuries, but almost never allow themselves to have to trade for necessities (and, truth be told, rarely export food or clothing as well), and contact with the outside world as a whole is limited. The technology level in a Sanctuary does vary somewhat from place to place, but none use the latest devices, and very few will even use clockwork or gunpowder. However, unlike a human or dwarven settlement, every single Sanctuary has at least one spellcaster living there, which is what allows the elves to survive in the modern era with so little technology.\n\nCommunication Network Edit\n\nMoreover, this omnipresence of spellcasters is key to a secret rarely revealed to non-elves, even by those who have left their Sanctuary. The armies of other races are occasionally confounded by elven reinforcements arriving from a completely unexpected direction, or finding similar technology or art in Sanctuaries that would seem to have no contact with each other. A magical communication network has been in existence for hundreds of years, possibly even thousands, using spellcasters as living conduits for the messages. Despite their apparent isolation, every Sanctuary is in communication with at least the Sanctuaries in the same region, and often even some hundreds of miles away. Moreover, even Sanctuaries thousands of miles apart can, through a series of connections, eventually exchange ideas and information. While a Sanctuary in Siberia might never directly speak to one in Southern Africa, they are both tied to the same grapevine, and if one absolutely needed to send a message to the other, it would get there eventually. Occasionally, rival or hostile Sanctuaries may attempt to break the chain between their enemies, but there is almost always a work-around path, although it may be a less efficient one.\n\nYear Abroad Edit\n\nFor one year in their young adulthood, every elf from a Sanctuary is required to leave home and explore the world. For that year, the young man or woman is not even permitted to visit their home community, though sometimes they do spend time at another Sanctuary. Others choose to spend the year in isolation in the woods or mountains, often developing a deep connection to the natural world even by elven standards. Most often by far, however, this year is spent exploring the communities of dwarves, humans, and gnomes, learning about their cultures, lifestyles, and technologies. For their part, the other races often treat these young elves as exotic curiosities, with young humans in particular known for their attempts to seduce the visitors. Gnomes tend to just be happy to have an interesting guest, and are known among elves as generous hosts, if a bit odd. Some elves never return from this year, either settling down in a non-elven community (most often large human cities) or choosing to spend their entire lives traveling. However, the vast majority find the outside world strange, uncomfortable, and startling, not to mention polluted, cold, and corrupted, and return to their original Sanctuary homes.\n\nTravelers Edit\n\nElven wanderers come from one of three sources. Some are simply born on the road, and never know anything else. Others discover a joy of traveling or of new lands and novelty in general during their year away from the Sanctuary, and take up the lifestyle. These elves often find that they enjoy the freedom of being outside of the frankly staid Sanctuaries, but also cannot handle"}

I was immediately met with sweet, almost hazelnut notes and a very nice mild spice. The ash was a nice white colour, and didn't seem at all flaky.\nAn inch and a half into this stick, the burn became uneven. I flipped it over to let the underside catch up, but it was no use. I had to even it up with a single torch lighter that one of the Jacks regulars had laying around. The mild spice had faded at that point into rich, much more spicy tobacco overtones with sweet coffee undertones. The ash held on for an inch and a half before falling off (albeit this was my fault, as I jostled the stick setting it down).\nMore than halfway through, the flavours started to change again. I love this about Rocky Patel cigars; generally, they are very fluid and changing throughout the length of the smoke.

I put the single torch to the uneven part once more. In the last two inches or so, it grew slightly hot, and I set it down to die.\nFinal verdict: very flavourful and changing stick (hazelnut, coffee, oak, spice) with nice ash and quite a few burn problems.

Stay tuned this week for pieces by Eminem on Tupac and Swizz Beatz on the Notorious B.I.G.\n\nEazy-E. Photo by Chi Modu\n\n\nKendrick Lamar. Photo by Christian San Jose\n\n\nI remember when I was five or six years old, waking up one morning and seeing this guy bust through the TV screen, rapping over some song called \" We Want Eazy \" -- I think the concept of the video was that he was actually in jail and he had to get to his show and the only way to get to his concert was to film him from jail, and he eventually busted through the jail and came onstage. I remember looking at that video and just feeling like, \"Man, this dude feels like an action superhero.\" Little did I know, Eazy-E came from my same neighborhood in Compton.My pops would play N.W.A. records all day, every day; my uncles would play it. My older cousins would play it. And I would go outside and see the same imagery in my reality as the things they were talking about on the record. From the way these guys talked to the way they carried themselves to the type of activities that they were involved in, the whole thing was a real life introspective report from the ghetto. Looking at them and sitting inside my community, it left a big toll on me because it always let me know that no matter how far I go, I gotta stay in reach of the people and what's going on in the neighborhood, whether it's a harsh reality or not.What made Eazy special was that he was telling a different type of truth, a truth that wasn't heard in music yet. Before them, rap was fun -- you had your battles and whatnot, but this time around, when it came to what Eazy wanted to do, being a visionary, he had the idea of speaking the honest truth, and I think it really resonated with a lot of people because it was the shock value of, \"Okay, these guys are really standing out and focused on telling their reality, no matter how pissed off you get by it.\" And it got interest from people. People actually wanted to hear it and wanted to know what was going on.But as a kid, I really couldn't grasp the idea that the world knew about what we're going through in my neighborhood. I didn't get that idea until my debut album,, came out and that's when I truly understood how N.W.A. felt, coming from this small neighborhood but going all the way around the world and seeing these people singing these words lyric-for-lyric and understanding the trials and tribulations that are going on in the community. I understand how they feel now. It's an inspiring thing. Once I got the idea that people are actually listening, it made me want to continue making music more.Somebody told me this early on: \"You're nothing without your own backyard.\" Period. If my backyard -- and my backyard being my city and my county -- doesn't believe me, then no one else will. I always remember that. I always kept that in the back of my mind and I think that's exactly what N.W.A. did, and that's why they said they want to make music for the community first, because to have that home love is like nothing else. You can go all the way across the world 10 times but when you come back to your city and see the pride and joy in these kids' faces, it's the ultimate feeling. I think that's exactly what they were thinking and it's exactly how I think today.I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for Eazy and I wouldn't be able to say the things that I say, talk about my community the way I talk about it, for good or for bad. He's 100% influenced me in terms of really being not only honest with myself, but honest about where I come from and being proud of where I come from.And it's not just me. Artists today wouldn't be able to talk about the things they talk about if it wasn't for Eazy-E and if it wasn't for gangsta rap. Period. You don't even have to be a gangsta rapper, but the fact that you can be able to talk about your community and some of its harsh realities, that comes from none other than Eazy-E, period.Because before then, everything was pop. People were scared to talk about these kinds of tough situations, but because he and the group took it upon themselves to talk about [these things], every artist is able to and they owe it to him. He's not only the birth of gangsta rap, but he's the birth of a whole legacy of being able to say what you want"}

Apparently, when you sweat, your sunblock runs. Just how did I get sunburned, you might be asking yourself. Well, after the last couple months we've had here at Kakos Industries, I felt it was time for a break, so I moved the entire staff to our vacation location on the beaches of Kakos Island. Where is Kakos Island? Well, I was surprised to find out that the official answer is \"Yes.\" That's right, the official answer from the officials here at Kakos Industries to the question starting with the word \"where\" is \"Yes.\" They could have made it \"Fuck you\", but I guess they weren't feeling quite that friendly. Could have been \"classified.\" Instead, it says \"Yes, The Ocean, Earth?\" With a question mark. The Division of Hiding and Seeking are a bunch of assholes, and everyone knows it. Kakos Island does have some year round staff, but there are also stations in the building here for most of our staff from the main branch.

They had to stay at the main branch. Also the people working on location specific projects. The rest of us get to split our time doing massive amounts of Evil, and hanging out on the beach. It's work, yes, but the change of scenery is nice. The Exectopode are enjoying their time in the water. I am told that Brosephus has the intention of teaching me to surf while we're here.

Still as firm as ever, Soundman? He's nodding yes. You know, I haven't thought about this before, but is there any chance that this is a medical condition, Soundman? Should we be worried about this erection that has lasted so long? He's shrugging. With a slightly worried look on his face. How about a friend? Do we need to get you a friend? I apologize for not asking sooner. He's shaking his head no. Shareholders, it seems that his only love is The Sound. In other news, I've seen Kimmie just sort of lying in the sand on the beach, no towel, half a bikini, and the tide threatening to take her away at any time.

Maybe they won't. I don't know what my reaction would be. I had some people call when they'd lost their coaches. I was honest with them.\"\n\nBut the honest truth has changed since then. And considering energy has played such a significant part in Sloan's decision-making, he's sounding as if a return could be in the cards.\n\n\"My energy level has changed a great deal since I quit coaching,\" said Sloan, who is an avid walker. \"It's changed a lot now.

{"id": 259575, "ended": true, "length": 780, "text": "A:\n\nWhen financing a company, \"cost\" is the measurable cost of obtaining capital. With debt, this is the interest expense a company pays on its debt. With equity, the cost of capital refers to the claim on earnings provided to shareholders for their ownership stake in the business.\n\nWhat Is Debt Financing?\n\nWhen a firm raises money for capital by selling debt instruments to investors, it is known as debt financing. In return for lending the money, the individuals or institutions become creditors and receive a promise that the principal and interest on the debt will be repaid on a regular schedule.\n\nWhat Is Equity Financing?\n\nEquity financing is the process of raising capital through the sale of shares in a company. With equity financing comes an ownership interest for shareholders. Equity financing may range from a few thousand dollars raised by an entrepreneur from a private investor to an initial public offering (IPO) on a stock exchange running into the billions.\n\nLower Cost of Financing: Debt Versus Equity\n\nProvided a company is expected to perform well, debt financing can usually be obtained at a lower effective cost.\n\nFor example, if you run a small business and need $40,000 of financing, you can either take out a $40,000 bank loan at a 10 percent interest rate or you can sell a 25 percent stake in your business to your neighbor for $40,000.\n\nSuppose your business earns a $20,000 profit during the next year. If you took the bank loan, your interest expense (cost of debt financing) would be $4,000, leaving you with $16,000 in profit.\n\nConversely, had you used equity financing, you would have zero debt (and as a result, no interest expense), but would keep only 75 percent of your profit (the other 25 percent being owned by your neighbor). Therefor, your personal profit would only be $15,000, or (75% x $20,000).\n\nFrom this example, you can see how it is less expensive for you, as the original shareholder of your company, to issue debt as opposed to equity. Taxes make the situation even better if you had debt, since interest expense is deducted from earnings before income taxes are levied, thus acting as a tax shield (although we have ignored taxes in this example for the sake of simplicity).\n\nOf course, the advantage of the fixed-interest nature of debt can also be a disadvantage. It presents a fixed expense, thus increasing a company's risk. Going back to our example, suppose your company only earned $5,000 during the next year. With debt financing, you would still have the same $4,000 of interest to pay, so you would be left with only $1,000 of profit ($5,000 - $4,000). With equity, you again have no interest expense, but only keep 75 percent of your profits, thus leaving you with $3,750 of profits (75% x $5,000).\n\nHowever, if a company fails to generate enough cash, the fixed-cost nature of debt can prove too burdensome. This basic idea represents the risk associated with debt financing.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCompanies are never totally certain what their earnings will amount to in the future (although they can make reasonable estimates). The more uncertain their future earnings, the more risk is presented. As a result, companies in very stable industries with consistent cash flows generally make heavier use of debt than companies in risky industries or companies who are very small and just beginning operations. New businesses with high uncertainty may have a difficult time obtaining debt financing, and often finance their operations largely through equity.\n\n(For more on the costs of capital, see \"Investors Need a Good WACC.\")"}

This is due to a combination of factors all coming together at the same time.\n\nEvery time a local video store closes, Quickflix gets stronger, picking up new trade. It has a library of 60,000 DVD & Blu-ray tiles and around 85% of those are being used most months.\n\n\"Nor surprisingly a lot of people assume that DVD is dead,\" says Langsford. \"But DVD sales and rentals in the US last year was $8 billion. The aggregate of all digital including streaming activity was about $2.7 billion.\"\n\nThe DVD side keeps the business healthy but it's the streaming which holds the upside.\n\nIn the three months to December, Quickflix grew its customers 10% to 120,000 including 18,000 or so on trial. For paying customers, growth was 4% for the quarter.\n\nQuickflix lost ground, and customers, when it launched streaming before it was ready in 2012. But the customer numbers are now rising fast.\n\nWhen Quicklfix this month announces its March quarter results, it is expected to be on the way to 140,000 customers.\n\n\"We have indicated to the market we are back in growth mode,\" says Langsford.\n\n\"The number of hours that we're streaming is growing at a clip of 20% per quarter. All the graphs are heading firmly in the right way.\"\n\nStreaming media is where the elephants, the Foxtels and Telstras, live.\n\nQuickflix streamed in the December quarter 40% more than it did in the same quarter the year be-fore.\n\nWhere it wins is on content and the growing lists of devices it can stream to. Some recent additions include PlayStation 4, LG Smart TVs, TiVo, Amazon Kindle Fire.\n\n\"Streaming is accessible over the widest range of devices of any player in Australia and New Zea-land including smart TVs; game consoles, mobile and tablet,\" Langsford says.\n\nQuickflix has both subscription and pay per view where the US-based Netflix offers only subscrip-tion and ITunes offers only pay per view.\n\nA combination of both allows Quickflix to offer the premium latest release content soon after re-lease plus the full range of top TV and the depth of the DVDs.\n\nFoxtel entered the market this month with Presto, an online movie library priced at $19.99 per months. Of course, it doesn't include TV shows because that's what Foxtel's main service sells.\n\nCompared that to Quickflix's $14.99 per month for streamed entertainment, including TV shows, plus access to the DVDs.\n\nFoxtel has a relatively low household penetration at 26% compared to the US where cable is in 85% of homes. Presto streaming is its answer to increasing penetration.\n\nQuickflix maintains a presence in Hollywood to make sure its relationships with producers is strong and that it continues to get the very best in content.\n\nThe other key strategy is ensuring that Quickflix can stream to any device.\n\nBusiness Insider Australia asked about Google Chromecast, not yet available here, but rumoured to be on its way.

They have a very long and sordid history of targeting minorities with their hate and too, too often does that hate transfer to murderous violence. By their own admission, these shit-for-brains use their rallies and marches to intimidate their victims. A racist march doubles as a recruiting tool and a statement; \"minorities of this community, we are here, we hate you and we want you gone\".

Despite the vast amount of data being available, it is difficult to truly analyze and interpret the data as a whole in its current form. Although the recent data are stored in csv format, older data are stored in html, or even scanned pdfs.\n\nIllinois has one of the largest international student populations in the US, and attracts over a third of its students from out of state. We thought it would be interesting to see the gender, race, and college breakdown at different geographical levels, and visualize where our classmates are coming from.\n\nIn order to do this, we break down the data into world, state, county and college levels and allows the users to interact with the data. Users can also explore the detailed view at each level, which provide visualizations of the aforementioned gender, race, college, and also yearly growth for the selected level.\n\nThis project was created by Clay Gregory, John Lee, and LJ Wong in Apr 2013 as part of CS467: Social Visualization, instructed by Karrie Karahalios at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.\n\nImportant Notes\n\nSome values presented in the visualization are estimates due data suppression in the provided records, preserving the privacy of individuals.

A May 15th press release from North Korea's Korean Central News Agency stated that he has now begun serving his sentence within a \"special prison.\" Bae, a devout Christian, is the owner of a North Korea tour company and was in the country with official permission when detained by North Korean authorities on November 3rd. What actually took place leading to his arrest has been the subject of much conjecture, but one thing is certain: Bae, a humanitarian who had compassion for North Korea's starving and abandoned orphans, is not indictable for any crime. Rather, he is a hostage being held to accommodate yet undetermined North Korean agenda.\n\nThe Bae case recalls the still unresolved case of a Christian minister and humanitarian, the Reverend Kim Dong-shik, who died in a North Korean prison. In 2000, North Korean agents crossed the border and hunted Kim down in China, where he was operating several underground shelters for North Korean refugees. He was abducted and taken back into North Korea, where he was reportedly tortured and starved to death. Given China's inhumane policy to forcibly repatriate North Koreans who manage to escape their country-gulag (a policy that has led to thousands of deaths and divided Korean families), one can safely assume China tolerated, if not sanctioned, the abduction. Kim was a US permanent resident whose wife and two children, all US citizens, are from Illinois.\n\nCareful examination of Kim's case exposes an unethical and dangerous double standard in United States foreign policy toward North Korea, specifically in reference to human rights violations, terrorism, and mass atrocity. In 2005, then Senator Barack Obama and 19 other Illinois lawmakers co-signed a letter to North Korea's UN mission, in which they promised not to support the de-listing of the DPRK government as a state sponsor of terrorism until a full accounting was given concerning the fate of Reverend Kim. North Korea has never accounted for Kim, and in 2008, when the Bush administration agreed to the removal of the DPRK from the state terrorism list, in an unprincipled (and eventually failed) attempt to broker a deal with Pyongyang on its nuclear activities, the Democratic nominee reversed positions. Kim's case has been essentially ignored by Washington ever since, although his death has been confirmed by South Korean intelligence.\n\nA 2011 report (pdf) from the US Committee for Human Rights in North Korea found that North Korea has abducted more than 180,000 people from 12 countries. The committee called on the United States to re-list North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism because of the abductions, which are categorized under 18 USC Section 2331 as acts of terrorism.\n\nUS officials and security analysts continue to make a grave mistake in concentrating their North Korea policy on somehow convincing the DPRK to dissolve its nuclear weapons program; a crisis that history has demonstrated with distinction cannot be resolved while the current regime remains in power. North Korea takes pride in its status as a nuclear state more than anything else and has stated on numerous occasions that their nuclear capability is non-negotiable, referring to it as a \"treasured sword.\" Concurrently, a war with North Korea would never commence by means of a DPRK nuclear strike, which would be tantamount to political suicide, but with covert terror operations such as what took place in Boston on April 15th\u2014the exact form of attack North Korea has repeatedly employed against South Korea and its citizens since its inception. On April 20th, North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency felt compelled to publicly deny any connection to the Boston Marathon bombings, stating that the DPRK \"has consistently maintained the stand of opposing all forms of terrorism.\" The official statement went on to add that \"When the DPRK feels necessary to strike the US, it would not resort to such heinous terrorism in hiding.\" Yet the facts of North Korea's international behavior suggests otherwise.\n\nOn April 15, 1969, for example, 31 American crewmen were killed when two North Korean MiG-17s shot down a US reconnaissance aircraft on a routine flight that at no time violated North Korean airspace. The US Navy intelligence plane had flown the identical route over the preceding three months without any occurrence. But this date, which marks the birth of Kim Il-sung, is the most important day of the North Korean calendar, and thus North Korea asserted that the aircraft had flown deep into its airspace and its air defense forces \"scored the brilliant battle success.\" In January of the preceding year, the USS Pueblo was attacked and abducted by North Korean warships in international waters. Eighty-two officers and crew were taken hostage and tortured; one was killed.\n\nIn August 1976, US soldiers entered the heavily guarded demilitarized neutral zone that separates North and South Korea to trim a tree that was blocking the view from an observation post. In what was later found to have been a pre-planned attack, 35 North Korean"}

You can drink more of it. In fact, you can replace your after-workout recovery drink with it. Cause it's been scientifically proven to aide muscle recovery just as much as Gatorade. A study published a while back in the International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism discusses the merits of chocolate milk over other sports recovery drinks. Check this out:\n\n\"In the study, nine male cyclists rode until their muscles were depleted of energy, then rested four hours and biked again until exhaustion. During the rest period, the cyclists drank low-fat chocolate milk, Gatorade, or Endurox R4. During a second round of exercise, the cyclists who drank the chocolate milk were able to bike about 50% longer than those who drank Endurox, and about as long as those who drank the Gatorade.\" (Article)\n\nAnd it's not just random scientists that's drinking the stuff after workouts. My former hometown University of Washington Huskies football team even uses it after every practice. Each player is required to drink a small carton before leaving the field.\n\n\"The Huskies are experimenting with a new form of nutritional replacement following practices. Along with giving the usual water and sports drinks to rehydrate and replenish during grueling preseason practices, Washington's football staff is requiring its players to drink a small carton of fat-free chocolate milk. \"It tastes good to me and, hey, if it's nutritious and helps my body, I'm all for it,\" wide receiver Cody Ellis said.\" (Article)\n\nSo there ya have it \u2013 do you really need any more excuse now to down chocolate?\n\nI've actually been using it since last summer and I've found it works pretty well. While I can't scientifically pinpoint chocolate milk as helping me personally to recover, I can say it seem to help\u2026and heck \u2013 it certainly tastes better than some of the recovery drinks out there.\n\nSpeaking of which, I usually just make my own chocolate milk from Hershey's Chocolate Syrup. I recently noticed that they have a 'Lite' version that has 50% less calories. I figured I'd give it a shot. Based on my extensive testing (really, it was hard work!), it tastes the same. The only interesting thing I've noticed is that it doesn't seem to mix as easily as the regular stuff. Meaning, it takes a bit more oomph to get it to mix 'cleanly' into the chocolate milk. Ya know\u2026like 4-5 more seconds of work. Just in case you were curious about the difference between the two options.\n\nSo go forth and drink thy chocolate milk!"}

That'll make accessing the internet somewhat easier for its residents, who typically have to use computers and connections at schools, offices, or government facilities.

All for giving up not much.\n\nDespite playing only one senior game in six years at Hawthorn, Noble said Lowden's speed would cause the opposition headaches and challenge Jenkins for the centre half forward spot.\n\n\"Josh has done fantastic job kicking 40 goals but no one has a hold on any position,\" he said.\n\n\"And when you go into a new season, we just like the fact that there is some genuine tall support for Jacobs and some challenges for the opposition to match-up on a tall guy who has got speed and can go forward and take a catch.\"\n\nThe Crows are optimistic about the prospects of young key defenders Sam Siggins (pick No. 62) promoted rookie Kyle Hartigan, who will get every opportunity to step up this season.\n\nBut the full-back position is arguably the biggest quandary for the Crows, especially if Talia gets hurt, with seemingly all other areas covered.\n\nNoble believed \"we think we've got most areas in reasonable shape\", but said new coach Phil Walsh wanted to \"build that defensive end\" in the trade period, and possibly, the draft.\n\n\"(Andy) Otten with a knee and 'Shawry' (Sam Shaw) coming of a knee, it was an area we needed to bolster with a bit of experience and we know that Kyle is very competitive and can bat above his weight,\" Noble said.\n\n\"So that gives us great flexibility, so we don't have to pull your defence around too much.\"\n\nDRAFT DECIDER\n\nAdelaide's options\n\nHugh Goddard (Geelong Falcons)\n\nH: 196cm W: 94kg\n\nKey defender/forward\n\nGoddard is a Ben Reid-style swingman who looked more comfortable in defence in the later part of the season.

What a pleasant surprise to play the game and find that it had character of its own and kept rewarding me with new toys throughout its substantial and entertainingly silly story. Sitting down to play the sequel I thought it would just be more of the same. Wrong, wrong, wrong.\n\nBefore I talk about the game, here's some info on where I played it. In a church, in Amsterdam. I'm not telling you this because the setting matters, if the game is good I'd gladly play it in a cardboard box in Slough, but because the placement of the things inside the church on that particular day was pleasing. The nave was full of 360s, lined up awaiting eager journalists but I was ushered past them and directed to the elevation of the crossing, between the transepts, right before the altar. That's where the PCs lived.\n\nWhen I'm invited to play a multiplatform title before release I expect to be plugged into a console so it was a pleasant surprise to have the PC build ready and waiting at all, let alone literally looking down on everybody else. The good news is, this time around we won't have to wait for a late release on PC. Development has been parallel across the platforms and although I was playing with an Xbox controller (as I will on release; it's that sort of game) and didn't have the chance to mess around with any settings beyond inverting my y-axis, it's clearly a handsome devil.\n\nNow, onto the reasons why I was getting ahead of myself by expecting a rehash. The big difference between Darksiders and Darksiders II is the protagonist. At times as I played through the final parts of the game's first substantial realm I was convinced that I understood the formula entirely; design a protagonist and then build a game around him. Levels, abilities, enemies, dialogue, worlds \u2013 all are in service to Death, the spider-like, dodgy, jumpy horseman whose story this sequel tells.\n\nTemporally, all of the action takes place alongside the events of the first game. While War was stomping around our Earthly post-apocalypse, smiting demons and angels alike, Death was traversing other, more mysterious realms. By more mysterious I mean more imaginative. It's not that I didn't enjoy the setting of the first game but I'd seen it before. I play games so burning cities filled with angry demons are as familiar to me as my own kitchen.\n\nDarksiders II moves away from the familiar and into more inventive territory. The Makers' Realm that I explored is part traditional fantasy, part proto-mechanical golem factory and altogether Vigil's own creation. As in the original, strong voicework and an interesting companion contribute to the world-building but it's Death himself who makes this a sequel that is more than a retread.\n\nIn some hands, a change of protagonist could mean a change of skin but Death is not War, though obviously related in many ways. It's a third-person action adventure with a similar visual style but, to return to somewhat lazy comparisons, this is less God of War and more Prince of Persia.\n\nThe towering, crumbling structures of the Makers' Realm are pathways as much as obstacles, tracks along which Death can clamber, climb and wall-run. I spent less time scything down enemies than I did looking for hand-holds, overhangs and broken machinery from which to swing. There's still plenty of combat, which involves the expected combos and side-splitting finishing moves, but it's once an area is cleared that Death shows what he brings to the party.\n\nRunning along walls above spitting lakes of lava, scaling a toppled tower, activating ancient and ominous machinery; that's what he does best. The Makers, from what I can gather, are the Genesis of all things and their realm is one of creation. Accompanied by one of the beings, best described as a giant dwarf, Death is attempting to activate a huge automaton that will assist him in his quest. However, a corruption has taken hold in this world and, presumably, all others, a webbing of dark fluids and crystals growing on surfaces and infecting some of the Makers' own machinery.\n\nTo clear it, Death can hop onto Custodians, large humanoid structures that have a sphere in place of their legs and trundle about smashing enemies into pieces. They're not just battle-mounts though, they're also the only means of clearing the corruption and therefore accessing new areas. And that's not all either. They can also fire large chains, slamming into distant walls to create a bridge. More still, as those spheres they roll about on fit perfectly into indents in the floor; parking on top of these changes the"}

This sentiment is unsurprisingly most pronounced in BC (60%), Quebec (62%) and Atlantic Canada (70%).\n\nWhat's also notable about the result is that although they didn't choose Liberal candidates on election night, a strong majority (71%) of those who voted NDP are nonetheless happy with the result. As has been canvassed in past ARI analyses, this finding speaks to a true motivation for change in government that eventually led many NDP supporters to vote Liberal on Oct. 19, trumping much of the disappointment that might be felt over the party's third-place finish. The same cannot be said for Conservative voters however, as seen in the graph below:\n\nGovernment priorities?\n\nCanadians' agenda for the new government closely reflects the issues they identified as most important during the campaign.\n\nAs it did in every poll ARI conducted during the campaign, \"the economy\" leads the way, with more than a third of Canadians (34%) choosing it as one of the two priorities Justin Trudeau should focus on first.\n\nOther economic issues \u2013 such as \"jobs/unemployment\" (25%), \"cost of living\" (20%), and \"taxes\" (16%) \u2013 also register high on the list.\n\nThe Trudeau Agenda:\n\nGiven the predominance of economic issues in the minds of the electorate, it should perhaps come as no surprise that the two most popular Trudeau campaign promises are economic in nature.\n\nSignature elements of Trudeau's tax policy \u2013 reducing the income tax rate for the middle class and increasing it for people who earn more than $200,000 per year \u2013 enjoy the support of the vast majority of Canadians, but not all of the Liberal leader's economic promises are well-liked.\n\nSummary tables for some key Trudeau campaign promises canvassed in this survey follow. For full results, including responses regarding support and opposition to all promises \u2013 see the comprehensive tables here.\n\nMore than four-in-five (83%) support cutting the income tax rate for middle income earners, and endorsement for this measure proposal is notably non-partisan. It reaches 80 per cent or higher among those who voted for each of the three major political parties Oct. 19.\n\nSimilarly, three-quarters (76%) of Canadians support Trudeau's plan to create a new tax bracket \u2013 with a 33 per cent tax rate \u2013 for those earning $200,000 or more. As with the middle class tax promise, nearly half of Canadians (49%) say they support it strongly, and majorities of each major party's voters support it. On this measure, however, the CPC majority is considerably narrower (56% support, compared to 87% of Liberals and 83% of New Democrats).\n\nNot all of Trudeau's economic promises enjoy support. Indeed, Canadians are now divided about the prospect of running $10 billion deficits for three years in order to invest $125 billion in infrastructure projects.\n\nThese findings are notably different from what ARI found when we asked a more abstract question about deficits and balanced budgets during the campaign. Asked to choose between the opposing statements \"the federal government should spend more in the next year on jobs and growth, even if it means deficits in the short term\" and \"the federal government should balance the budget in the next year, even if it means raising taxes or cutting programs,\" nearly three-quarters (73%) of Canadians opted for the former.\n\nThe comparatively tepid support for Trudeau's deficit plan may be a result of its concrete"}

The company plans to use electricity at night, when it's cheap, to compress air into an underground cavern. The company then releases the air through turbines to generate electricity when the price is right.\n\nThe only thing holding back this 30-year-old technology has been the economics. The difference between the high and low prices in a 24-hour period has not been large enough to generate a reasonable return on the capital investment.\n\nTexas' wholesale electricity market and huge nightly wind resource, though, make compressed air energy storage viable, said Jack Farley, CEO of Apex-CAES. Build enough compressed air energy storage, and Texas would never have to burn coal again, and consumers would enjoy even lower electricity prices, he told me.\n\n\"I think you could turn off all fossil-fuel generators in Texas when you wanted to,\" he said.\n\nApex-CAES is raising $500 million to build its first facility near Palestine. Located near five existing natural gas storage caverns, the compressed air would spin turbines rated at 317 megawatts, capable of generating 15,000 megawatt-hours of electricity over two days without a recharge. The company, though, would never want to release all the air.\n\nThe big opportunity for energy storage companies, whether they use batteries, compressed air or hydroelectric dams, is to keep the electric grid balanced as people turn appliances on and off and while generators ramp up and shut down. Sources of electricity that keep the system smoothed out are called ancillary services, and they earn a premium from grid operators like ERCOT, the nonprofit grid manager that supplies electricity to most of Texas.\n\nERCOT also pays a premium for responsive reserves, electricity that is immediately available on a moment's notice in case of an emergency. While compressed air energy can't compete with low-priced natural gas or wind in the bulk electricity market, it can compete to offer reliable ancillary services.\n\nCompressed air has both a price and operational advantage over batteries. Salt caverns are cheaper than lithium-ion batteries, and the system can fill the cavern with air while generating electricity. You can't charge and discharge a battery at the same time.\n\nOperators can easily and quickly adjust output to match the needs of the grid - unlike with a natural gas turbine. In many ways, compressed air storage operates like a hydroelectric dam.\n\n\"ERCOT uses a regulation product every second of every day. They deploy responsive reserves about eight times per month, every month of the year,\" Farley said. \"We would be there for the grid 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to balance the system and keep it at 60 hertz.\"\n\nThe secret sauce is Texas' cheap wind power, which during the spring, fall and much of the winter is basically free at night because there is so much of it.\n\nTexas has 19 gigawatts of installed wind turbine capacity and is expected to add another 10 gigawatts by 2020.\n\nThe only thing preventing Texas from building more wind, solar and compressed air energy storage is the low price of natural gas.\n\nWith prices averaging below $3 for a million BTUs, the electricity business is a tough place to make a profit right now.\n\nOld attitudes are also a problem. Critics of clean energy complain about the intermittence of wind and solar power, and the high cost of lithium-ion batteries. Sure, solar is strongest during the day and wind produces the most at night, but the weather doesn't always cooperate.\n\nThe renewable energy sector, though, is maturing, and because tax credits for it are rolling off by 2020, smart people are working to solve those problems.\n\nFarley has identified suitable salt domes and caverns across most of the U.S. Wind and solar companies are building widely dispersed assets so that when weather is bad at one location, it's probably good at another.\n\nAmericans are also waking up to the social benefits of converting to renewable energy and storage. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have calculated that shutting down coal plants and replacing them with natural gas has saved tens of thousands of lives. Getting rid of coal altogether would save tens of thousands more.\n\nApex will need a small amount of natural gas to heat the air it compresses to maximize turbine output. But storage facilities could limit natural gas usage to when demand peaks in the summer and winter while eliminating the need for coal completely.\n\nThe power sector is undergoing a revolution, and Americans should embrace and encourage startups like Apex-CAES. Just as innovators found a way to produce natural gas from shale rock and produce huge amounts of oil and natural gas,"}

But they made up for it quickly after the election. According to an analysis by the Center for Public Integrity, \"oil, gas and coal companies and executives contributed more than $1 out of every $10 raised for Trump's inauguration, for which he raised nearly $107 million overall\" (a new record).\n\nThe love affair between Trump and fossil fuel companies has blossomed ever since. Recently, Kathleen Sgamma, president of the oil and gas trade group Western Energy Alliance, gushed to the New York Times, \"not in our wildest dreams, never did we expect to get everything.\"\n\n\"Everything,\" in this case, denotes a long list of friendly appointments and regulatory rollbacks. For all its controversies, distractions, failures, and unfilled jobs, the Trump administration has been steady and true in its devotion to fossil fuel interests, giving them a greater presence inside executive agencies, stripping them of regulatory restraints, and proposing to defund their competitors.\n\nThere are some areas of policy where Trump faces friction from courts, Congress, or other elements of the conservative coalition. He has stumbled on health care, on his travel ban, and on foreign policy. But when it comes to environmental and energy policy, the coalition is aligned. All the party's most powerful and influential factions support a pro-fossil, anti-regulatory agenda; there is an extensive infrastructure of big money, think tanks, and lobbyists built to support it.\n\nIt's worth noting that a pro-fossil fuel, anti-regulatory approach is not particularly popular in the US, in either party. Majorities in every congressional district support limiting local pollution and carbon emissions from coal plants. Majorities in every Congressional district believe America's focus should turn toward wind and solar. Majorities in every state support the Paris climate agreement.\n\nBut the money and intensity on the GOP side support fossil fuels. And there is no faction on the right that cares enough about climate or environmental issues to prioritize them over the larger culture war. So there is no friction.\n\nThe relative lack of conflict makes the fossil fuel takeover quieter than other parts of the Trump reality show, but not for lack of activity. Trump has moved aggressively to make good on his promises.\n\nIn its first 100 days, the administration overturned, reversed, or suspended 23 environmental rules and regulations. Even the White House website has vanished any mention of climate change and replaced it with a paean to energy production.\n\nIt's been a full-court press. In this post, I'm going to review a few of the highlights \u2014 some of the people with whom the administration is staffing its agencies, as well as a few of the rule and procedure changes it has already put in place. It is by no means comprehensive (and will likely soon be out of date), but it should offer some perspective on the sheer breadth of the administration's work on behalf of fossil fuels.\n\nLike so many areas of Trump policy, it is reminiscent of George W. Bush's administration, only more shameless. It is too soon to say if Trump will be \"worse than Bush\" on this score, but it's already clear that he feels less of a need to cover his decisions with a veneer of \"balance.\" [more]"}

Here's why you should never rely on these meaningless numbers.\n\nWhy feed hits are a meaningless stat\n\nEvery time a podcast app check for new episodes, it's checking for updated information from your RSS feed. That counts as a feed hit each time.\n\nTools like FeedBurner, FeedBlitz, and some startup podcast hosting companies may offer stats on how many times your feed is loaded.\n\nBut such a stat doesn't tell you the true size of your audience, for the following six reasons.\n\n1. There is no measurement standard\n\nUnlike the industry standard we have for measuring podcast downloads, there is no association setting a standard or guideline for measuring feed hits.\n\nFor example, should only full downloads of the feed be counted, or should head requests (probably checking the \"Last-Modified\" date) be counted, too?\n\n2. Apps refresh feeds throughout the day\n\nWhereas a podcast episode is usually downloaded only once, a podcast RSS feed will be loaded multiple times. Some apps refresh the feed every hour. Some apps refresh even more frequently than that!\n\nThis then requires more filtering to reduce the excessive duplication by IP address.\n\n3. There's no way to track a single device across multiple IP addresses\n\nSpeaking of IP addresses, most mobile devices will probably have at least three different IP addresses in an average day: one for home, one for work, and one for mobile. But there could be even more if your mobile device automatically connects to additional wifi networks (such as a store, a coffee shop, a friends house, etc.). And if you leave a particular region, it's likely your mobile data provider will give your device a new IP address as the location changes.\n\nFor media downloads, this kind of IP address behavior can be accounted for with some different filtering and crossreferencing. Even at the simplest level of measurement, podcast apps will download an episode only once unless the user forces it to redownload.\n\nBut since mobile devices refresh the feeds throughout the day and their IP addresses change as their location changes, a single device could show up as multiple devices based on RSS feed hits.\n\n4. Feed traffic varies every day\n\nPodcast RSS feeds are only checked based on app settings and user interaction. This usually results in lower activity on the weekends. Measuring RSS feed hits would make it seem like your audience unsubscribes on the weekends.\n\nMany website statistics tools, such as Google Analytics, will track a user across multiple visits, so it's easy to see how many unique visits you had across time (such as a week or month). But FeedBurner and other RSS tools don't offer such tracking, and thus report only a daily number or an average across days (but not tied to actual users).\n\n5. Feed stats exclude non-RSS plays\n\nTrying to measure \"subscribers\" raises the question, what really is a \"subscriber\"? While it may seem reasonable to say anyone who has pressed \"Subscribe\" on your podcast is a subscriber, that excludes many loyal audience members.\n\nSome people will faithfully visit your website and press play on your latest episodes. Some people will watch or listen on social networks. Some people will add your podcast to their app without actually subscribing to it. Some people use apps or services that subscribe to your feed only once for thousands of users (such as Stitcher, iHeartRadio, or Google Play Music).\n\nPeople on those platforms could still be loyal consumers of your podcast, but they're not individually subscribed to your own RSS feed. Thus, anything that tracks you audience through RSS hits or downloads will not count any of these other loyal fans.\n\n6. iOS 11 refreshes feeds repeatedly (possible bug)\n\nLastly, Apple Podcasts in iOS 11 introduced some strange new behavior regarding podcast RSS feeds. This is resulting in a significant increase is feed hits since iOS 11.\n\nWhile there are different theories to explain this, we do not yet know whether this is an intentional design by Apple or a bug in the app. But we can compare these daily feed hits to daily downloads and see this increase is not an actual increase in audience.\n\nWhy downloads per month/week/day is a meaningless stat\n\nYou'll often see podcasters speak highly of their downloads per week, per month, or per day. While some numbers can be fun to celebrate (my own Noodle Mix Network reached 15 million total downloads in Fall 2017), these \"downloads per time\" (DPT) don't really mean much; they don't tell you any truth about the size of the audience!\n\nHere's why.\n\n1. It's not enough information\n\nDownloads per time tell us nothing about the podcast's actual reach. It doesn't tell us how many episodes were published, how many episodes were already available"}

I wonder if they have amended that number to remove the hate crimes they can prove are hoaxes. Like this one from Philadelphia where a black man was busted for vandalizing cars with pro-Trump, racist, and anti-Semitic graffiti.\n\nPhilly.com reports:\n\nA 58-year-old South Jersey man has been arrested and charged with vandalizing several vehicles and homes in South Philadelphia on the day after the presidential election, police announced Thursday. William Tucker, of the unit block of Hemmings Way in Lawnside, Camden County, has been arrested and charged in the early-morning Nov. 9 incidents on the 900 block of South Sixth Street, at the border of Bella Vista and Queen Village, police said.\n\nThe graffiti, which was on cars, store fronts, and walls ranged from Trump's name to swastikas. One black woman's car was defaced with \"Trump Rules\" and \"Black Bitch.\" Residents were so offended that white people were apologizing and offering the black woman to pay for the graffiti removal.\n\nOne indignant resident who saw the offending tag said, \"If we were to put any president's name on that wall, it wouldn't be an offensive thing, but unfortunately, Trump has made himself synonymous with hateful rhetoric.\"\n\nBut as it turned out, it wasn't Trump or his supporters with the hateful rhetoric, it was a black man who was trying to make it seem like the President-elect was inspiring a wave of hatred across the country.\n\nNot only was Tucker captured on surveillance video committing some of these acts, an anonymous tipster ratted him out to the police. He was charged with 4 counts of criminal mischief and amazingly released on his own recognizance. Are you kidding me? He perpetrated a hate crime hoax and did thousands of dollars in damages and they just let him go with a summons?\n\nImagine if they had arrested a white man for this crime. That fictional racist would get slapped with multiple felonies with hate crime enhancements and would be looking at a six-figure bail. There would also be a Justice Department civil rights investigation with additional charges. On top of all that, it would be a major-outrager national news story instead of a brief mention in a local paper.\n\nTo the SPLC, who are trying desperately to verify all of the Trump-inspired hate crimes they claim are destroying the country, they can take these ones off of the list:\n\nRacist pro-Trump graffiti in Philadelphia was done by a black man.\n\nBlack woman in Kentucky who said white boys in Trump shirts threw rocks at her was lying.\n\nIn Chicago a lesbian faked a series of Trump-related threatening letters to herself.\n\nA black man in Massachusetts lied about being attacked by white Trump supporters.\n\nA black woman in Delaware lied about white Trump supporters threatening her with a gun.\n\nAn Asian woman in Minnesota lied about being attacked by a group of Trump-suppporting white men who told her to leave the country.\n\nA Muslim woman in Louisiana lied about being beaten by a white man in a Trump hat.\n\nReally, the SPLC could take all of their hate crimes off of the list, for the simple fact that there is no evidence that any of them actually happened. They won't however because they are in the business of scaring people with fake racism.\n\nFollow Brian Anderson on Twitter"}

{"id": 259605, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "When installing a cell phone signal booster in your home, office, or vehicle, you want to make sure to get every extra ounce of boosting power out of it that you can. We want you to be using your signal booster in the most effective and efficient way possible, so we've compiled a list of things that you can do today to get the most boosting power for your money.\n\nBefore You Begin\n\nThe one thing that we see confuse people more than anything else is the difference between the different networks on each carrier. Signal boosters will only work for the carriers and networks that they're intended for, so it's important that you're looking at the same network on your phone that your signal booster is supposed to be boosting.\n\nOne example which trips up a lot of people is the 4G network that they see on AT&T, which actually runs over the 3G frequency. The newest 4G network is depicted as 4G LTE on AT&T phones, and runs over a completely different frequency than AT&T 3G and 4G.\n\nSignal boosters which boost 3G signal will improve the signal for a phone on AT&T 4G, but will not improve the signal for a phone on AT&T 4G LTE, since it's a different frequency. Thus, if you're trying to improve the effectiveness of your 3G signal booster, and you're on 4G LTE, you won't see any change in signal strength. You'll need to disable 4G LTE, which will then fall back to to the 3G frequency, and you'll be able to see the improved signal.\n\nThis also applies if you have a 4G LTE only signal booster, and your phone is showing that you're on the AT&T 4G network. You won't see any change in signal, since those are two different frequencies. Once you're sure the network your phone is on matches the network that you're trying to boost, then you can go ahead with improving the effectiveness of your signal booster.\n\nTips for Assembling Your Signal Booster System\n\nHere are a few tips for when you're assembling your signal booster system that will maximize it's effectiveness with minimal effort:\n\nAlways use the shortest cable lengths possible.\n\nThe longer the cable, the more signal loss there will be. If your cable is too long, then choose a shorter length cable rather than rolling it up, which can cause interference and signal loss.\n\nAlways use the best cable possible.\n\nSome signal boosters, like many of the Wi-Ex ones, come with lower quality cables which cause a large amount of signal loss. Remember, the better the cable, the less signal loss you'll experience. Here are some guidelines for the majority of situations:\n\nIf your kit comes with RG-59-Mini Cable, upgrade to RG-6 cable.\n\nIf your kit comes with RG-58 cable, upgrade to LMR-400.\n\nMake sure there is enough separation between antennas.\n\nHaving the antennas too close together will cause your signal booster to automatically reduce its power and effectiveness. If you can't increase the distance between antennas, try shielding one from the other, as mentioned in our article about \"How to Prevent Oscillation\".\n\nOnce you have your cell phone signal booster installed in place and still aren't getting the performance that you'd like, then you can try the following options for your specific scenario:\n\nIf Your Signal Booster has an Omnidirectional Antenna\n\nOmnidirectional antennas are easier to install, but are generally far less powerful than directional antennas. We only recommend omnidirectional antennas in cases where the outside signal strength is very good and you need to cover multiple carriers at the same time.\n\nIf your outside signal strength is less than 4 bars and you DO NOT need to cover multiple carriers, we recommend upgrading to a directional antenna. If you're not sure what directional antenna would work best for your system, feel free to contact us.\n\nIf your outside signal strength is less than 4 bars and you DO need to cover multiple carriers, you'll need to determine if the carriers' towers are in the same general direction, in which case you can use a single directional antenna. If the towers are in multiple directions, you may be able to use multiple directional antennas or you could upgrade to a higher-gain omnidirectional antenna. Contact us for help figuring out which is best for your situation.\n\nIf Your Signal Booster has a Directional Antenna\n\nDirectional antennas are more powerful than omnidirectional, however they do need to be aimed in the direction of the carrier's tower. Carriers can add new towers and decommission old ones at any time, so if you notice that your signal is no longer as strong as it used to be, you should go through the aiming process again to ensure that the outside antenna is pointed in the best possible direction to maximize boosting power.\n\nIf the Space"}

Others said the crunching of bodies or the \"loud pop\" of cars colliding. For those who witnessed the fatal terror attack in Charlottesville on Saturday, the sounds were impossible to forget.\n\nLeader of neo-Nazi group linked to Charlottesville attack was a US marine Read more\n\nWesley Barton was standing only a few feet away from the road as 20-year-old James Fields, an apparent white supremacist, allegedly plowed his Dodge Charger into a crowd of anti-fascist protesters. Barton could feel the air rush past as the car accelerated. The 32-year-old chef pushed his younger sister out of its path and watched in horror as it sped down the street.\n\n\"You could hear bones cracking. You could hear everything,\" he said.\n\nHis mother, 51-year-old Ngozi Beaufort, a lifelong Charlottesville resident, was a block away when she heard the screams. She rushed towards the noise, fearing her children had been killed.\n\nAs she reached the corner of Water Street and Fourth, she saw the woman who was killed, 32-year-old paralegal Heather Heyer, lying on the concrete. She was receiving CPR, but her body was already limp, Beaufort said.\n\n\"It put me in a sort of daze. I've never seen anything like that,\" she said, almost disbelievingly. \"That girl died right there in front of me. I'll live with it for the rest of my life.\"\n\nThe violence on Saturday that left Heyer dead and 19 others wounded was the culmination of a summer of antagonism and racism in Charlottesville, as the city and its bid to remove a public monument to the Confederacy became the target of a sustained campaign by white nationalists. The climate of terror has been felt no more acutely than among African Americans residents such as Barton and Beaufort.\n\nThose monsters that I saw \u2026 looked like they were your everyday CEO, your professor, your doctor, your lawyer Ngozi Beaufort\n\n\"Back in the day, you knew who didn't like you and who were your friends,\" said Beaufort. \"But those monsters that I saw on Friday and Saturday, they looked like they were your everyday CEO, your professor, your doctor, your lawyer, your police. They were clean-cut. So now I'm kind of suspicious of anybody who is white.\"\n\nEmily Gorcenski, a 35-year-old prominent local anti-fascist activist, was standing at the opposite end of the street to Barton, watching as the Dodge Charger accelerated towards her and the large crowd on Saturday afternoon. It sounded like a pop as it collided with another vehicle in front, she said.\n\n\"It was a sinking feeling. I knew instantly it was an attack,\" Gorcenski said. \"My first thought was that he's going to run out and start shooting people.\"\n\nRather than freeze, Gorcenski said she ran straight towards the vehicle, and unholstered her Sig Sauer handgun. In her mind, she was prepared for a gunfight.\n\nA Charlottesville resident of nine years, Gorcenski, a trans woman, backs strict gun control. But earlier in the year, after online death threats from white nationalists intensified, she felt compelled to purchase a firearm for her own protection, she said.\n\nAs the driver quickly reversed the car away from the protest, Gorcenski realized her weapon would not be needed. She turned to see \"blood on the streets, bloodied people everywhere\", and set about trying to help the wounded.\n\nIt was only later that she realized a close friend, who did not want to be named, had been badly injured, suffering spinal damage and two broken legs. Since the weekend's violence Gorcenski had not left her home. The experience, she said, was too traumatic.\n\nAtreyu Jackson, 20, came face to face with torch-wielding white nationalists the night before the fatal attack, when a group of around 400 marched through the University of Virginia campus and set upon a group of students.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Atreyu Jackson (left) and Wesley Barton (right) in Charlottesville: 'You could hear bones cracking.

Net neutrality is actually hugely important.\"\n\nThe FCC's antiquated and under funded systems crashed under the volume of calls and submissions shortly after Oliver's remarks.\n\nThe FCC fined CBS a record $500,000 over the Jackson incident, though that fine was eventually overturned on appeal. Several big media conglomerates imposed a blacklist on Jackson's music and videos in the immediate wake of the scandal."}

He recently signed on to play Luke Cage in Netflix's series of Marvel Universe TV shows, making his screen debut as Power Man opposite Krysten Ritter in AKA Jessica Jones, before his own headline series. He'll be most familiar to UK viewers for his various roles in The Following, American Horror Story and The Good Wife. However for gamers, he's Jameson Locke in Halo 5 and the star of new videogame movie Halo: Nightfall produced by Ridley Scott.\n\nCould you give us a brief synopsis of Halo: Nightfall?\n\nBasically it's the origin story of Jameson Locke. After a terrorist attack on another planet he ends up working with local authority soldiers to retrieve something that could destroy us all. He's a guy who has been in the military his whole life, essentially special forces. He's not used to working with people who question him. He has to keep on course regardless, the mission must be completed even if it's suicide. He values life but sees the bigger picture.\n\nHow did you get involved with the project?\n\nRidley Scott was part of the production team on The Good Wife. I auditioned on my iPhone and it moved very quickly after that as they thought I was right for the role and pretty soon I was filming in Iceland for two months.\n\nHow was Iceland?\n\nIt was freezing. In between takes, our teeth were chattering. It was supposed to be hot in the film so we were out there with hardly anything on. It's a beautiful country but rained all the time. The film was like a rain magnet.\n\nWere you a Halo fan already?\n\nI was aware of the game before; it's like Coca-Cola, it's a huge brand. I'm always game for creating a new character and I liked the idea of putting something new into the Halo universe.\n\nYou then went onto voice Jameson Locke in the forthcoming Halo 5: Guardians. How did you find that experience?\n\nI felt like a fish out of water. As an actor you're trying to capture the nuances of real life but voice work is almost over-acting. So I found it very hard to judge if I was doing it right. Then when they put it together with the motion capture it was very exciting, almost 3D. Creepy, but exciting.\n\nVideogame movies don't always have the best reputation; did you have any reservations getting involved with Halo: Nightfall?\n\nI had some trepidation but with Ridley Scott involved, at the very least, I felt comfortable there would be a certain standard. I hadn't really done action before and this was an opportunity to bring my brand somewhere else, to go somewhere new as an actor, which was another reason to do it.\n\nAnd do you think it helped you land the role of Luke Cage?\n\nIt couldn't have hurt. And I really wanted the opportunity to do another physical role as there are only so many years you can do this kind of stuff.\n\nWhat can you tell us about the Luke Cage TV series on Netflix?\n\nMarvel actually gives you a special training class in how not to say too much in interviews [laughs]. We're in the middle of shooting AKA Jessica Jones and Luke Cage is a very interesting character who just happens to have super strength and unbreakable skin. He's a neighbourhood hero, very much linked to New York and Jessica Jones. It's all part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe but Luke Cage is a darker, grittier, more tangible character than Iron Man or Thor. He likes to keep things close to his chest, operate on the hush-hush. He has these abilities but he's not sure how and when to use them. He's a very nuanced character.\n\nWhat are you working on next?\n\nLuke Cage will be taking up a lot of my time. Exactly where he's going next I don't know. I'm also working on Agent X with Sharon Stone so I'm juggling them at the moment.\n\nHalo: Nightfall (Anchor Bay) is available on DVD and Blu-Ray from Mon 16 Mar."}

Wall Street moguls (and by that term I mean the largest financial firms in the country) who committed securities fraud on a grand scale and crashed the economy requiring the US taxpayers to bail them out, on the other hand, routinely pass go with nary a worry that their \"indiscretions\" will result in prosecution.

An analysis by The New York Times of S.E.C. investigations over the last decade found nearly 350 instances where the agency has given big Wall Street institutions and other financial companies a pass on those or other sanctions. Those instances also include waivers permitting firms to underwrite certain stock and bond sales and manage mutual fund portfolios. JPMorganChase, for example, has settled six fraud cases in the last 13 years, including one with a $228 million settlement last summer, but it has obtained at least 22 waivers, in part by arguing that it has \"a strong record of compliance with securities laws.\" Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, which merged in 2009, have settled 15 fraud cases and received at least 39 waivers.\n\nThis is a bipartisan failure, for it has not made any difference who sat in the Oval Office over the past decade, the results have been the same. The rich financiers fleece the rest of us while making profits off their criminal malfeasance, and both Republican and Democratic administrations have turned a blind eye toward their fraud and deceit, crimes that have cost our economy trillions of dollars, led to massive unemployment and what would be called outright theft, if an individual burglar were involved rather than a multi-billion dollar institution.\n\nYet, why should they change their ways? No one is holding them accountable now for their nefarious schemes. We've have had proof since a Congressional Committee report issued last year that Wall Street firms rigged the Mortgage backed derivatives game to benefit themselves and defraud their customers on a massive scale:\n\nThe great and powerful Oz of Wall Street was not the only target of Wall Street and the Financial Crisis: Anatomy of a Financial Collapse, the 650-page report just released by the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Democrat Carl Levin of Michigan, alongside Republican Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. Their unusually scathing bipartisan report also includes case studies of Washington Mutual and Deutsche Bank, providing a panoramic portrait of a bubble era that produced the most destructive crime spree in our history \u2014 \"a million fraud cases a year\" is how one former regulator puts it.\n\nThese fraudulent criminal schemes led to the near collapse of our global economy, yet what has been done since then to bring the principals, corporations and individual alike, who were responsible for these frauds, to justice? Next to nothing, unfortunately. Republicans rail against the (meager) oversight and reforms passed by the Democrats prior to the 2010 mid-term elections and would overturn them in a heartbeat if they could, and prominent Democrats, including my Senator from New York, Chuck Schumer stands in Wall Street's corner, ever alert to protect these \"mobsters\" (for that is in effect what they are) from ever having to face the music.\n\nAnd people still question why the Occupy Wall Street movement arose, organically, and attracted so many adherents to its cause despite lack of funding from billionaires like the Koch brothers, physical abuse by law enforcement of peaceful protesters and the unlawful use of force and arrests of thousands of people merely for seeking to express their first amendment rights.\n\nThe answer is obvious. It's as plain as the millions of corporate dollars pouring into to \"Super Pacs\" to run unprecedented numbers of attack ads in 2010 and in the Republican primaries this year, thanks to a Supreme Court that defines money as speech and includes corporations as \"persons\" (albeit persons with far more cash to exercise their \"free speech rights), and no police officers to bash in their skulls, or use pepper spray designed to thwart grizzly bear attacks against them, when they do.\n\nWe are in the midst of a crisis far worse than any we have faced since the Civil War. A crisis that has resulted in the loss of our civil liberties at the expense of monopolistic multinational corporations. It is a fair question to ask if we are even a democracy anymore, though we follow the forms of holding elections, because of the the immense influence corporations exert over the individuals we \"elect\" as"}

Their vehicle eVe can achieve more than 100 km/h.\n\nThe official mark of the new speed record is 106.966 km/h. The previous one of 73 km/h had stood for 26 years.\n\nThe main advantage of eVe is that it is not only an electric car, but uses solar power too. The car uses solar panels on the roof and also has a hood to charge a 60kg battery. However, the panels were switched off during the world-record attempt, leaving the car to run solely on the battery charge. According to the engineers, eVe can cover 800km from a single charge.\n\nThe world record was unofficially broken on July 23 at a racetrack in Geelong, Victoria, Australia. However, the record in this field must be officially approved by the International Automobile Federation (FIA), which is the world motorsport's governing body. And, finally, in October the organization issued a new update of the records and approved the Sunswift team's achievement.\n\nSunswift was founded in 1996 and it's Australia's top solar car racing team. This record is not their first. They have already set a world record for the fastest solar powered road trip from Perth to Sydney, and a Guinness World Record for the fastest solar car.\n\nMore than 100 students at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) have contributed to the record attempt over the past two years.\n\n\"It's not often you can confidently say you made history before you even graduated,\" Sunswift's project director and undergraduate engineering student Hayden Smith said in a statement.\n\nWith an official world record the team can now concentrate on a new challenge, which is to modify their car to meet road registration requirements. Smith said the car could be registered and appear on city streets within a year. The team is sure the car is ready for everyday use.\n\n\"Five hundred kilometers is pretty much as far as a normal person would want to drive in a single day,\" Smith said. \"It's another demonstration that one day you could be driving our car.\"\n\n\"We've always wanted to keep pushing the cultural change towards electric vehicles, and this is another big step in that direction,\" he added. \"This record was about establishing a whole new level of single-charge travel for high-speed electric vehicles, which we hope will revolutionize the electric car industry.\"\n\nUNSW officials also expressed their feeling concerning the record.\n\nUNSW Engineering Dean Professor Graham Davies said that for a student project to achieve a new world record for electric vehicle speed and endurance \"is truly remarkable.\"\n\n\"It goes to show what exceptional students we have here at UNSW.\""}

It had predicted in January that the economy would reach full capacity by the second half of 2014.\n\n\"That's a very strong signal that they are not in hike mode until at least 2015, and even then, it's not as if you get worried about inflation pressures instantly once you close off spare capacity \u2014 you need to get the economy into material excess demand and that can happen well after that,\" Holt said.\n\nThe Canadian dollar closed down Wednesday following the forecast, falling 0.58 of a cent to 97.41 cents US."}

{"id": 259619, "ended": true, "length": 745, "text": "By Whitney Webb\n\nEven though Fukushima was the worst environmental disaster to have taken place in the last 30 years, you probably haven't heard much about it. After the Tohoku earthquake in eastern Japan and subsequent tsunami, one of the cooling systems at Fukushima's Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) nuclear power plant failed. The result was a devastating triple reactor meltdown that led to the evacuation of over half a million people and the creation of a 20-kilometer exclusion zone.\n\nEver since the disaster, TEPCO as well as the Japanese government have consistently tried to downplay the disaster's impacts nationally and globally. The collusion was so blatant that even TEPCO's company president, Naomi Hirose, admitted that a \"cover-up\" had taken place.\n\nHowever, some of Fukushima's effects are so obvious that even the Japanese government cannot continue to deny the enormity of the 2011 disaster. Within the last five years, many of the workers present at the Fukushima nuclear plant during the meltdown, as well as those involved in its clean-up, have developed cancer. Of the numerous workers seeking compensation, only two workers with leukemia were found to be entitled to workplace compensation by the Japanese health ministry. Yet, neither of these workers have so far received any money from the government for their treatment.\n\nNow, that is set to change. On Friday, Japan's health ministry concluded that another worker, diagnosed with thyroid cancer three years ago, developed his illness due to radiation exposure during his time working for TEPCO. The man had worked at several nuclear power plants with the company between 1992 and 2012 and was present at the Fukushima plant during the disaster. The radiation present in the man's body was found to be about 150 millisieverts, with 140 of which were believed to be a result of the 2011 disaster. This marks the first time that a former worker with thyroid cancer has won the right to work-related compensation as many other similar cases were previously rejected by the Japanese government.\n\nThis most recent confirmed case of Fukushima-related cancer ultimately forced the hand of the Japanese government, prompting them to release their overall position on workers compensation for those who worked at the plant before and after the catastrophe. Officials said that workers who had been exposed to over 100 millisieverts and developed cancer five years or more after the disaster were entitled to compensation, though this quantity of radiation was said to be a \"yardstick\" \u2013 not a strict standard. According to a joint study by the UN and TEPCO, about 174 former workers are believed to have been exposed to over 100 millisieverts of radiation. However, the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported that more than 2,000 workers have radiation exceeding 100 millisieverts in their thyroid gland alone.\n\nThough this new policy is good news for former TEPCO employees, it does little to address the growing epidemic of thyroid cancer among Fukushima citizens. Thyroid cancer rates have soared since the disaster. The trend is particularly noticeable among Fukushima's youngest residents as 131 children have been diagnosed with thyroid cancer since 2011.\n\nDespite the spike in thyroid cancer, the Japanese government, TEPCO, and even the United Nations have insisted that there is \"no direct link\" between exposure to Fukushima radiation and thyroid cancer. However, exposure to Iodine-131, the main radionuclide released into the air and water during the meltdown, is known to increase one's risk of thyroid cancer and is the most clearly defined environmental factor associated with thyroid tumors. If the Japanese government is offering compensation to workers for radiation exposure, it must also extend help to the disaster's youngest victims."}

The series follows a tempestuous relationship between the meek and shy Hong Seol (Kim Go Eun) with fourth year all-rounder and extremely popular yet mysterious Yoo Jung (Park Hae Jin). As they journey through the intense ups and downs of dating for twenty-year-olds amidst the chaotic life that college students face.\n\nCheese in the Trap had so much potential.\n\nThe first phrase that comes to mind when I'm reviewing this drama is \u2014 had so much potential \u2014 which is always a bittersweet feeling because I definitely enjoyed certain aspects of the show, yet I feel like it could have been so much better. Cheese in the Trap has a compelling storyline and gifted actors, but it still felt like a show that \"almost\" got the formula right.\n\nEpisodes 1-5 Review\n\nThe intro episodes of Cheese in the Trap quickly establish the cast of main characters through their behaviors and interactions. Hong Seol is timid, quiet, and afraid to openly express her thoughts. However, being quiet earns her the accolade of being secretly observant among her loud group of friends. The series immediately begins with a tense scene, where Hong Seol notices a sinister smile across Yoo Jung's lips as he spills water on a friend's skirt. So she immediately treats him with suspicion and distrust, especially when he's so admired and popular at their university.\n\nIt's also clear that Hong Seol always ends up in tricky, troublesome situations. In one instance, she gets dropped from a class she signed up for, and she suspects Yoo jung for pranking her. But she's awkward with Yoo Jung as acquaintances so she cannot openly bring it up with him.\n\nNext, we meet the Baek siblings \u2014 the blunt and thuggish Baek In Ho (Seo Kang Joon) and his larger-than-life, obnoxious, over dramatic sister Baek In Ha (Lee Sung Kyung). The Baek siblings have ties with Yoo Jung's family, but have been cut off, so they must fend for themselves. The tension between them and Jung escalates when In Ho crosses paths with Seol and warns her against dating Jung, who is known to be cold and unresponsive while interacting with the Baek siblings.\n\nSlowly, there is positive progression for Hong Seol and Yoo Jung's relationship. And because other girls are jealous of the attention Yoo Jung shows Seol, she's always put in uncomfortable situations. One night, one of the jealous classmates directs a drunkard towards the desolated building that Hong Seol is studying in, and the police arrive to see Hong Seol's arm bleeding from the wound left by the drunkard waving his bottle around. However, Yoo Jung is always trying to help Seol get out of these problems and goes out of his way to protect her. As Seol notices him trying to get closer, she eventually gives in and accepts his offer to spend time together.\n\nHowever, the flirtatious unpredictability of her time spent with Yoo jung will have to wait as Seol continuously has problems of her own. She's always doing other people favors \u2014 be it her mother's plea to move four hours away from her apartment to reduce household costs or forsaking sleep to finish a presentation that no one else in her group is motivated to do. I particularly enjoyed Hong Seol's self-narrations; they provide the viewer with insights into her mind and her personality. She's constantly stressed from the slack she cuts everyone else, and she does so partly out of benevolence and partly because she's not assertive.\n\nSoon, we also see the triangle between In Ho, Seol, and Jung begins to emerge. As In Ho moves into Seol's neighborhood and spend more time together, they develop an open, honest friendship that is refreshing to watch compared to the intense, unpredictable relationship she shares with Jung, despite the fact that they start dating.\n\nThe first few episodes definitely pack in a lot of interactions between the various characters, but its true merit lies within its focus on the lead pair, Seol and Jung. I really enjoyed how Cheese in the Trap juxtaposes the moments they spend together, where Jung is polite, soft-spoken and gentle, against the moments he deals with others in a cold, emotionless way. It makes Jung a complicated but intriguing lead with an unanswered question of which is the real him.\n\nEpisodes 6-10 Review\n\nThese episodes of Cheese in the Trap dig deeper into the character transformations and the complications of Seol and Jung's relationship despite the obvious chemistry they share. Seol is constantly caught between feeling affectionate towards Jung for helping her and caring for her, and feeling upset when she un"}

(Marco Bello/Reuters)\n\nAll this year, as they trudged through an unprecedented economic implosion, Venezuelans have been gearing up for what was meant to be the defining political event of the year: a referendum on whether to recall our increasingly loathed authoritarian president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. The tense buildup suddenly ended Thursday as five separate (and supposedly independent, but c'mon now) lower courts approved injunctions to suspend the recall, closing down Venezuela's last best hope for a peaceful solution to its long-running political crisis.\n\nEven for battle-hardened Venezuelans, it all came as quite a shock. A major signature-gathering drive to officially activate the recall vote was scheduled for next week. Opposition activists were busy preparing their plans to get out their voters to sign. No one, not even the military, seemed to have been expecting this.\n\nToday has been a day of sober reckoning in Caracas, as Venezuelans process the death of the recall process and its implications. It's easy to overdramatize these things, I realize, but it's also important not to lose the forest for the trees: a relatively large, relatively sophisticated major oil producer just three hours' flying time from the United States has just become the second all-out, no-more-elections dictatorship in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThis is serious. A turning point.\n\nSee, for 17 years, political scientists have been casting about for a suitable way of describing the strange in-between political system Hugo Ch\u00e1vez invented for Venezuela. It wasn't quite democracy in the usual sense, clearly, but it also wasn't a normal dictatorship. The government might not have had much time for the fine print of constitutional rule, but in broad terms people were basically free to associate, speak and vote. What do you call that? Competitive authoritarianism? A hybrid regime? An illiberal democracy? None of the labels seemed to stick; what did stick was the lasting impression of in-betweenness, of Venezuela as not-quite-a-dictatorship.\n\nFor Venezuela's pro-democracy activists, fighting a regime that has instituted dictatorship by tiny increments has been an exhausting ordeal. Which is why today, mixed with the genuine anger at the subversion of our constitutional right to a recall, you can detect just a hint of gratitude for the clarity this brings.\n\nWe're rid of the adjectives. We are finally through with the academic circumlocutions.\n\nThere's no need to hyphenate it anymore. Venezuela is just a dictatorship."}

{"id": 259626, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "As described in the previous three posts, evolution wired humans to be moral, to form supernatural beliefs, and to sustain those beliefs. Yet, we are not genetically predisposed to believe Jesus is the son of God or Muhammad spoke to the angel Gabriel. In other words, religious traditions are a product of cultural evolution, not biological evolution. As societies went from tribal to modern, and as cultures interacted with one another, supernatural beliefs and religious traditions morphed to better suit the needs of their host civilizations. As time went on, only the most useful religions were left standing.\nHamatsa Shaman. 1914.\nHunter Gatherer Religions\nFor hundreds of thousands of years, our ancestors lived in small bands hunting and gathering to survive. We can glean a sense of what their religious life might have been like by looking at the traditions of modern isolated tribes in places like Brazil, Africa, and New Guinea. These societies hold beliefs in invisible agents who are responsible for diseases, weather, and other natural events. [1] These agents tend to be quite amoral and whimsical, and most tribal societies don't use them to inspire proper moral behavior. [2] Given that humans evolved to be cooperative and compassionate within small groups, these tribes tend to be good at maintaining social harmony on their own without religious inspired moral doctrines. [3] Another common element in these societies is the presence of an individual (e.g. a shaman) whose sole function is to communicate with these invisible agents to ask favors on the tribe's behalf. [4] As the scholar Mircea Eliade wrote, \"What is fundamental and universal is the shaman's struggle against what we could call 'the powers of evil.' \u2026 It is consoling and comforting to know that a member of the community is able to see what is hidden and invisible to the rest and to bring back direct and reliable information from the supernatural worlds.\" [5]\nReligions of Chiefdoms and State Societies\nWhile most hunter gatherer societies had very little political or religious organization, as they evolved to chiefdoms and state societies, politics and religion needed to become more sophisticated in order for these cultures to function. [6] Oftentimes, those who spoke on behalf of the gods ended up gaining political control of these societies. [7] They would use their special connection to the gods to legitimize their right to rule, and some would even claim to be gods themselves. For example, the pharaohs of ancient Egypt were believed to be gods, and many Roman emperors were also deified. [8] [9] Since these societies tended to have far more than 150 constituents (the maximum size for a cohesive social unit,) formalized moral and ethical codes were essential for maintaining social harmony. [10] In addition, incorporating divine retribution for moral indiscretions was an effective way of ensuring citizens would follow the rules, even when no one was looking. [11] These divine laws were generally only applied to fellow adherents of any particular religion. Given that these larger societies were often in conflict with neighboring chiefdoms/states, religious intolerance was a useful way to inspire nationalism and motivate citizens to kill political/cultural enemies. [12] In short, as human civilizations became increasingly complex, religion functioned as a mechanism to maintain social harmony and to further the aims of the political elite.\nEvolution of Mythology\nRoman mosaic C3rd A.D., Sousse Museum, Tunis \u00a0\nAs I define it, mythology encompasses the stories behind the gods, spirits, and/or agents who are venerated by a particular religious tradition. In the book When They Severed Earth from Sky: How the Human Mind Shapes Myth a rchaeologist Elizabeth Wayland Barber and her historian husband Paul T. Barber argued that these stories were the method by which ancient humans would transmit vital information over many generations. [13] As time went on, only a few elements of the original stories would remain, thus obfuscating their initial meanings. For example, what does a one-eyed monster that bellows from on top of a mountain and hurls boulders at people sound like? According to the Barbers, the original story of the Cyclops may have actually been a tale to warn people about the dangers of a volcano. [14] In ancient societies, this morphing of mythology became exacerbated as different cultures interacted with one another and merged. Oftentimes, the character of certain gods would change as the cultural contexts shifted. For example, Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea, was originally an Indo-European horse god that assimilated the qualities of several Near Eastern aquatic deities. [15] As the culture took on more of a seafaring role, his aquatic qualities overtook his original equestrian ones. Eventually, when Rome became the dominant culture of the west, they used Poseidon as the template for their own god Neptune. [16]\nSurvival of the Fittest Religion\nThe survivability of a religion depended on its ability to spread its message,"}

Fix this by making the schema type NOT NULL or by changing the Scala type to Option[Double] \u2715 C05 indepyear SMALLINT (int2) NULL \u2192 - Column is unused.

Currently this is based on instantiated Meta instances, which is not ideal; hopefully in the next release the tooling will improve to support all instances in scope.\n\nAnyway, if we fix all of these problems and try again, we get a clean bill of health.\n\ncase class Country ( code : String , name : String , pop : Int , gnp : Option [ BigDecimal ]) def biggerThan ( minPop : Int ) = sql \"\"\" select code, name, population, gnp from country where population > $minPop \"\"\" . query [ Country ]\n\nscala> biggerThan(0).check.run select code,"}

He also claims many are 12-foot, blood-drinking, shape-shifting lizards.\n\nIt has also been reported (correctly) that presidents Clinton, Bush the Second, and Obama all attended conferences before they were elected, as were British prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair.\n\nThis is taken by some as proof that the group picked them for their roles, but Bilderberg founder and British cabinet minister Dennis Healey said that invitations are simply issued to people who show potential.\n\nIn an interview with journalist Jon Ronson for the documentary \"Secret Rulers of the World\", Healey said that the group was set up to allow people at the top of their respective fields to discuss world issues, and while attendance does give the advantage of networking, it's not a sinister cabal set on world domination.\n\n\"To say we were striving for a one-world government is exaggerated, but not wholly unfair,\" he said. \"Those of us in Bilderberg felt we couldn't go on forever fighting one another for nothing and killing people and rendering millions homeless. So we felt that a single community throughout the world would be a good thing.\" \u00ae"}

Even by Ontario standards, ours isn't (see this, and this, and this; note that this is really just the same thing as ours, just much higher, with ski runs).\n\nHamilton Mountain, from Wentworth Street.

And even after the city began to develop above the escarpment, it remained a line dividing old from new, and marking a boundary for demographics and politics. It gave us electrical power. It presented a major transportation challenge \u2014 while it was conquered by long-gone incline railways and a number of mountain access roads, occasionally Mother Nature has shown us who really is the boss (the Claremont and the Sherman Access being the most recent examples) and she will surely do so again. It also affects patterns of air flow, and sometimes the weather differs between above and below.\n\nThe mountain has been Giver of Waterfalls and Mother of Trails. It is scaled by stairways. It used to provide a couple of inner-city ski hills. Visually, it is a rocky and leafy backdrop for the skyline of the lower city, and from the top it's just a great view of the city and beyond.\n\nIt's hard to imagine Hamilton without The Mountain.

It is actually a hormone, a steroid hormone that is produced out of cholesterol when your skin is exposed to the sun. For this reason, vitamin D is often referred to as the \"sunshine\" vitamin. However, sun exposure is often inadequate these days, making it necessary for people to get more of it from the diet (or supplements). This is important, because vitamin D is absolutely essential for optimal health (1). Unfortunately, only a handful of foods contain significant amounts of this vitamin, and deficiency is extremely common (2, 3). In fact, according to data from 2005-2006, a whopping 41.6% of the US population is deficient in this critical vitamin/hormone (4). This article explains everything you need to know about vitamin D.\n\nWhat Is Vitamin D? Vitamin D is one of the fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K), meaning that it dissolves in fat/oil and can be stored in the body for a long time. There are actually two main forms found in the diet (5): Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol): Found in some animal foods, like fatty fish and egg yolks.\n\nFound in some animal foods, like fatty fish and egg yolks. Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol): Found in some mushrooms. Of the two, D3 (cholecalciferol) is the one we're interested in, because it is almost twice as effective at increasing blood levels of vitamin D as the D2 form (6, 7). Bottom Line: Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin that can be stored in the body for long periods of time. There are two main forms, D2 and D3, of which D3 is much more effective.\n\nWhat Does Vitamin D Do in The Body? Vitamin D is actually pretty useless at first. It needs to go through two conversion steps to become \"active\" (8, 9). First, it is converted to calcidiol, or 25(OH)D, in the liver. This is the storage form of the vitamin in the body. Second, it is converted to calcitriol, or 1,25(OH)2D, mostly in the kidneys. This is the active, steroid hormone form of vitamin D. Calcitriol travels around the body, going into the nuclei of cells. There it interacts with a receptor called the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which is found in almost every single cell of the body (10, 11). When the active form of vitamin D binds to this receptor, it turns genes on or off, leading to changes in the cells (12, 13). This is similar to how most other steroid hormones work. It is well known that vitamin D affects various cells related to bone health, for example telling the cells in the gut to absorb calcium and phosphorus (14). But scientists have now found it to be involved in all sorts of other processes, including immune function and protection against cancer (15). So people who are deficient in vitamin D will be deficient in calcitriol (the steroid hormone form), so in effect they are deficient in one of the body's critical hormones. Bottom Line: Vitamin D is turned into calcidiol, the storage form of the vitamin, which is then converted into calcitriol, the active steroid form. Calcitriol binds to the vitamin D receptor inside cells, turning genes on or off.\n\nSunshine Is The Best Way to Get Vitamin D Vitamin D can be produced out of cholesterol in the skin, when it is exposed to the sun. The ultraviolet B (UVB) rays from the sun provide the energy needed for the reaction to occur (16). If you live where there is abundant sun year round, then you can probably get all the vitamin D you need by just going outside and sunbathing a few times per week. Keep in mind that you need to expose a large part of your body. If you're only exposing your face and hands then you will produce much less vitamin D. Also, if you stay behind glass or use sunscreen, then you will produce less vitamin D, or none at all. This makes the advice to use sunscreen to protect against skin cancer highly questionable. It raises your risk of vitamin D deficiency, which may lead to other diseases instead (17). If you decide to get your vitamin D from the sun, just make sure to never, ever burn. Sunshine is healthy, but sunburns can cause premature aging of the skin and raise your risk of skin cancer (18, 19). If you're staying in the sun for a long time, consider going without sunscreen for the first 10-30 minutes or so (depending on your sensitivity to sun), then apply it before you start burning. Vitamin D gets stored in the body for a long time, weeks or months, so you may only need occasional sun to keep your blood levels"}

If it proves viable \u2013 and that's a big \"if\" \u2013 behind closed doors there's talk of Snowy 3.0, Snowy 4.0 and Snowy 5.0, quadrupling the output to around 8000 megawatts, making it the largest power-grid battery in the world, dwarfing exisitng schemes in the US and China. \"The more we head down towards decarbonising the economy, the more pumped hydro and hydro in general, the more important they will become in the whole energy market,\" Snowy Hydro chief executive officer Paul Broad says. But not everyone is a convert. Danny Price, managing director of Frontier Economics and an energy sector veteran, is scathing. \"Pumped hydro makes no economic sense. It will never be built,\" he says bluntly. The Snowy Hydro Tumut 3 power station in Talbingo. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen\n\nUnderpinning Broad's vision splendid is a simple concept: pumped hydro. Traditional hydro gathers rainfall in alpine dams, gravity feeds the water down pipes to spin turbines and generate electricity. Pumped hydro reverses the process, using electricity to pump the water back uphill into those self-same dams. The water can then be reused, making more electricity when demand warrants it. It's a way of storing electricity; a giant battery. The great advantage of hydro power, whether traditional or pumped, is that it can quickly provide large amounts of power for sustained amounts of time, known as \"peaking\" generation. The big coal-fired power stations provide base-load power, but their output cannot be quickly ramped up or cut back to match demand, while wind and solar remain hostage to the weather. Snowy 2.0 would require a 26-kilometre tunnel linking Tantangara Reservoir to Talbingo Reservoir, a bolt-on to the 145 kilometres of tunnels in the existing Snowy Mountains scheme. Tantangara Reservoir dams the headwaters of the Murrumbidgee River at around 1200 metres above sea level; Talbingo Reservoir sits on the Tumut River below 600 metres. It's that dramatic difference in altitude that would enable significant amounts of power to be generated using a relatively small amount of water. A new 2000 megawatt power station would be built 800 metres underground, nine kilometres from the end of the tunnel, accessed from the surface down a slanting, 3.5 kilometre road tunnel. The new station would be the biggest hydro station in Australia.\n\nSnowy 2.0 would would require no new dams or reservoirs and additional transmission lines would follow existing corridors. Most of the construction would take place underground. Nevertheless, it is entirely situated within the Kosciusko National Park. An access road to the new power station would be required and there is the vexed question of what to do with the spoil \u2013 the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of rock carved out of the mountain to form the tunnels. Nevertheless, the Australian Conservation Foundation has cautiously welcomed the proposal, saying it's better than new coal or gas generation. \"[But] it's unlikely that it can deliver affordable, reliable electricity faster than comparable investment in wind or solar,\" ACF's Gavan McFadzean says. Snowy 2.0 would provide an added benefit, helping to relieve an existing bottleneck restricting the Tumut 3 station's output. Producing up to 1800 megawatts, it's by far Snowy Hydro's biggest existing power station, but it's dependent on water flowing down the Tumut River through the much smaller Tumut 1 and Tumut 2 power stations and into Talbingo Reservoir. It takes 10 days for enough water to pass through T1 and T2 to provide enough water for T3 to operate for one day at full capacity. That bottleneck has already proved near disastrous. In early February, temperatures in Canberra and Sydney exceeded 40 degrees, placing extreme stress on the grid. \"On the tenth of February this year in New South Wales, the lights stayed on because T3 was going flat out. And we almost ran out of water,\" Broad recalls.\n\nThe new scheme would permit water to flow directly from Tantangara through the new station into Talbingo Reservoir, increasing the water available to Tumut 3. The two stations, both with pumped hydro, could then run in tandem. This is the genesis for expanding Snowy 2.0 even further. The new station could generate more power than Tumut 3 while using only a quarter of its water, due to the large altitude differential between Tantangara and Talbingo. That's why engineers believe the concept could be replicated up to three-fold: Snowy 3.0, Snow"}

(Photo: KAREN BLEIER, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nHillary Clinton's tenure as President Obama's first secretary of State from 2009 through January 2013 was marked by extreme turmoil in the Middle East. It included the Arab Spring protests, Iranian nuclear brinkmanship and withdrawal of U.S. troops in Iraq. Republican rival Donald Trump said her tenure at State left a legacy of \"death, destruction and weakness.\"\n\nHere is what Trump said, plus events before, during and after her time as secretary:\n\nResidents gather at the site of a bomb attack in Syria's northeastern city of Qamishli on July 27, 2016. A massive bomb blast claimed by the Islamic State killed at least 44 people and wounded dozens in the Kurdish-majority Syrian city, according to Syrian state media. (Photo: DELIL SOULEIMAN, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nISLAMIC STATE (ISIS or ISIL):\n\nTrump said: \"In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map. ... ISIS has spread across the region, and the world. \"\n\nBefore Clinton: ISIS was al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), which launched a bloody campaign against Iraq's Shiite Muslim majority and U.S. troops. AQI faded into obscurity after an increase in U.S. troops in 2007 teamed up with Sunni Arab tribes to combat the group.\n\nClinton's role: Obama's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011 and the start of the Syrian civil war that same year created turmoil that allowed AQI to re-emerge. Obama rejected Clinton's advice to take a more aggressive approach toward Syria to protect civilians and empower moderate and secular rebels to topple Syrian President Bashar Assad's brutal regime. She also saw the war as an opportunity to sever Syria's close alliance with Iran. It's not clear if Clinton's approach would have prevented AQI from re-emerging and later branding itself as the Islamic State.\n\nAfter Clinton: Over the next three years, ISIS took advantage of growing instability in Syria to seize territory there, but it did not gain international notoriety until it occupied portions of neighboring Iraq in June 2014, more than a year after Clinton left State. The group has since plotted or inspired followers to launch terrorist attacks around the world.\n\nA man waves a rifle as buildings and cars are engulfed in flames after being set on fire inside the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012. (Photo: STR, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nLIBYA\n\nTrump said: \"Libya was cooperating. ... Libya is in ruins, and our Ambassador and his staff were left helpless to die at the hands of savage killers.\"\n\nBefore Clinton: Libya and its strongman leader, Moammar Gaddafi, renounced the country's nuclear weapons program in 2003 and allowed the United States and Britain to destroy its nuclear weapons infrastructure. Libya earlier renounced terrorism as well, turning over terror suspects and paying compensation to the victims of Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing all 259 aboard.\n\nClinton's role: When the Arab Spring uprisings in neighboring Tunisia and Egypt spread to Libya in 2011, Gaddafi sought to put the revolt down by force. Clinton helped develop the NATO campaign to stop him. Libya's rebels gained momentum and overthrew Gaddafi. The ensuing power vacuum gave rise to militias, including al-Qaeda, which launched a terrorist attack that killed U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans at a U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012. In the following days, Clinton and the White House wrongly blamed the attack on a protest over an anti-Islam video, and only later acknowledged there was no protest and it was a planned terrorist attack. Obama and Clinton had a plan for stabilizing Libya after Gaddafi's fall, but Libya's transitional government rejected any role for foreign troops.\n\nAfter Clinton: Multiple investigations by Clinton's State Department and congressional panels found that State did not provide enough security at the diplomatic post in Benghazi, but little more could have been done to protect the Americans once the attack began. Libya's warring factions formed a government this year, opening the door to U.S. assistance to defeat the Islamic State, which took advantage of the chaos to grab territory in parts of the country.\n\nThen-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testifies before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, on Jan. 23, 2013.

I'm sure in all our lives, there are moments that freeze in your memory . . . and I think for me, last night was one of those moments.\"\n\nAlto, along with Coun. Charlayne Thornton-Joe and Mayor Lisa Helps, brought forward the resolution as a result of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Calls to Action, released last summer that revealed the wrongdoings of Canadians against First Nations in residential schools.\n\nThe Checkers Pavilion, a cross-shaped lookout building, currently occupies the hilltop, but it has not been used since the 1970s and was labelled unsafe to enter in 1995.\n\nAs part of the repatriation, the pavilion will be torn down, allowing local First Nations to build a roughly 2,000-square-foot long house, which will be used for traditional carving, cultural activities and provide a space to train the next generation of carvers in traditional arts.\n\nFor thousands of years, the pavilion has been a well-known sacred site for local First Nations, as well as First Nations from as far north as Alaska and as far south as northern California. It was seen as a social and economic gathering place where they exchanged information, goods, stories and history.\n\nHowever, they lost the land in 1842 and Beacon Hill Park was turned over to the city in 1882.\n\n\"This is very personal for the Songhees and Esquimalt First Nations. This was a very important area for them and having the city say, 'as part of our journey towards reconciliation, we want to repatriate this space and work with you',\" Alto said, adding the city is one of the first on the Island to turn the calls to action into something tangible.\n\nDuring the meeting, a number of members of the community stayed well into the early hours of the morning to express their support for the resolution. One woman even brought a petition that had more than 150 signatures asking the city to move ahead with the project.\n\nThe city and local First Nations will work together to decide what type of building will occupy the site and seek funding from the federal government.\n\nAlto said the longhouse should be constructed in time for Canada's 150th birthday celebrations in 2017.\n\nCalls to the Esquimalt and Songhees First Nations were not returned by press time."}

And that money has come directly out of the pockets of workers through the Social Security payroll tax.\n\nThe report, \"Wheels of Fortune,\" finds that fees paid by the Social Security Administration to those representing disability applicants totaled $1.23 billion last year.\n\nBy October of this year, these fees had already topped $970 million.\n\nThe way the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program works is that, if a person secures legal representation while applying for benefits, and then qualifies for the program, the advocate gets a cut of the money.\n\nThe idea behind these payments \u2014 which are capped at $6,000 per enrollee \u2014 is to make sure that no one is denied disability benefits simply because they can't afford to navigate the system.\n\nBut as the Manhattan Institute report notes, lawyers have \"found ways to exploit legal rules in disability statutes to their personal benefit.\" The paper highlights allegations of fraud, kickbacks and other schemes to get the maximum number of people on the disability rolls.\n\nIn addition, those who've been turned down twice by the program can appeal their denials to an administrative law judge, some of whom have a record of approving 90% or more of those appeals.\n\nNot surprisingly, the amount of money lawyers collected in SSDI fees nearly tripled between 2001 and 2013.\n\nAt the same time, the number of workers on disability has been climbing at a rate far faster than people known to have disabilities.\n\nBetween 2002 and 2010, SSDI rolls shot up 48%, even though the number of actual working-age disabled climbed only 15%, according to Census Bureau data.\n\nAlmost half of the nearly 9 million workers collecting SSDI benefits had enrolled in the program in just the past five years.\n\nNot surprisingly, SSDI's costs have exploded as well, with spending up 155% since 2000 \u2014 faster than other major entitlement programs. Social Security, for example, climbed 90% over those years; Medicare spending rose 153%; and Medicaid was up 125%, budget data show.\n\nAnd at $140 billion, the federal government now spends more on disabled workers than it does on education, housing aid, and food stamps combined.\n\n\"Disability insurance has become more like permanent unemployment insurance or a general welfare program,\" notes Tad DeHaven of the Cato Institute.\n\nTo be sure, the extent to which aggressive fee-seeking attorneys are to blame for the sharp rise in the disability rolls isn't entirely clear.\n\nBut the promise of those fees, combined with looser eligibility rules and more generous disability benefits, has created the perfect entitlement storm.\n\nLeft unchecked, SSDI's trust fund will go bankrupt in 2016, forcing Congress to take some action to avoid a massive benefits cut. The disability boom also is draining funds from Medicare \u2014 since enrollees are eligible for that program after two years.\n\nAnd it's dampening economic growth, because those who go on SSDI almost ever rejoin the workforce, thereby shrinking the available pool of labor.\n\nFollow John Merline on Twitter: @IBD_JMerline"}

Some customers wanted recoveries based on their final account statements, even if the amounts shown were made up.\n\nPicard has estimated that Madoff victims lost about $20 billion from the fraud.\n\nBernard Madoff, 74, pleaded guilty in March 2009 and is serving a 150-year sentence in a North Carolina federal prison.\n\nThe new distribution by the trustee is likely to boost the mini-market of trading in the rights to any potential recoveries.

Most people think this is self-evident, but physical realism has been struggling with the facts of physics for some time now. The paradoxes that baffled physics last century still baffle it today, and its great hopes of string theory and supersymmetry aren't leading anywhere.\n\nIn contrast, quantum theory works, but quantum waves that entangle, superpose, then collapse to a point are physically impossible\u2014they must be \"imaginary.\" So for the first time in history, a theory of what doesn't exist is successfully predicting what does\u2014but how can the unreal predict the real?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuantum realism is the opposite view\u2014that the quantum world is real and is creating the physical world as a virtual reality. Quantum mechanics thus predicts physical mechanics because it causes them. Physics saying that quantum states don't exist is like the Wizard of Oz telling Dorothy, \"Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.\"\n\nQuantum realism isn't The Matrix, where the other world making ours was also physical. Nor is it a brain-in-a-vat idea, as this virtuality was in play long before humans came along. Nor is it that a phantom other world modifies ours\u2014our physical world is the phantom. In physical realism, the quantum world is impossible, but in quantum realism the physical world is impossible\u2014unless it is a virtual reality\u2014as these examples demonstrate.\n\n5. Our Universe Has A Maximum Speed\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhysical Realism: Einstein deduced that nothing goes faster than light in a vacuum from how our world behaves, and this has subsequently been considered a universal constant, but it isn't clear why this is the case. Currently: \"the speed of light is a constant because it just is, and because light is not made of anything simpler.\"\n\nTo answer \"Why can't things go faster and faster?\" with \"Because they can't\" is hardly satisfactory. Light slows down in water or glass, and when it moves in water we say the medium is water, and when it moves in glass we say the medium is glass, but when it moves in empty space we fall silent. How can a wave vibrate nothing? There is no physical basis for light to move in empty space at all, let alone define the fastest speed possible.\n\nQuantum Realism: If the physical world is a virtual reality, it is the product of information processing. Information is defined as a choice from a finite set, so the processing changing it must also be finite, and indeed our world does refresh at a finite rate. A supercomputer processor refreshes 10 quadrillion times a second, and our universe refreshes a trillion, trillion times faster than that, but the principle is the same. As a screen image has pixels and a refresh rate, so our world has Planck Length and Planck Time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this scenario, the speed of light is the fastest speed because the network can't transmit anything faster than one pixel per cycle\u2014i.e., Planck Length divided by Planck Time, or about 300,000 kilometers per second. The speed of light should really have been called the speed of space.\n\n4. Our Time Is Malleable\n\nPhysical Realism: In Einstein's twin paradox, one twin traveling in a rocket at nearly the speed of light returns a year later to find his twin brother an old man of 80. Neither twin knew their time ran differently and neither lost a heartbeat, but one's life is nearly over and the other's is just starting. This seems impossible in an objective reality, but time really does slow down for particles in accelerators. In the 1970s, scientists flew atomic clocks on aircraft around the world to prove they ticked slower than synchronized ones on the ground. But how can time, the arbiter of all change, itself be subject to change?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQuantum Realism: A virtual reality would be subject to virtual time, where each processing cycle is one \"tick.\" Every gamer knows that when the computer is busy the screen lags\u2014game time slows down under load. Likewise, time in our world slows down with speed or near massive bodies, suggesting that it is virtual. So the rocket twin only aged a year because that was all the processing cycles the system busy moving him could spare. What changed was his virtual time.\n\n3. Our Space Curves\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhysical Realism: According to Einstein's theory of relativity, the Sun keeps the Earth in orbit by curving space around it, but how can space itself curve? Space by definition is that in which movement occurs, so for space to curve it has to exist in another space, which is an infinite regression. If matter exists in a space of nothing, for that nothing to move (or curve) is impossible.\n\nQuantum Realism: An \"idle\""}

The sheriff's office conducted the initial probe before turning the investigation over to the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, a division of the Ohio Attorney General's Office, which handled the prosecution. The felony charges carried a maximum possible one-year prison sentence on each count. Brian Deckert, an associate assistant attorney general, had recommended a one-year prison sentence for Hammonds but he did not oppose her request for probation. At Monday's sentencing hearing, Deckert said Hammonds was paid an hourly rate and not per voter registration, so it was not \"a situation where she had a quota system \u2026 I think it just may have come down to human laziness,\" he said of Hammonds' actions. Public defender Jennifer Gorby attributed her client's actions to \"a lack of judgment on her part\" and that she engaged in this behavior to keep her job.\n\nHammonds claims that she believes that no one at OOC was aware of her activities.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that there is another reason besides laziness that could be a factor. For example, Hammonds may have intended for someone to actually use those registrations to cast fraudulent votes in an attempt to sway elections.

Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire even went so far as to claim that it's highly unlikely anyone will be using Bitcoin in five or ten years.\n\nShortly thereafter, Circle announced that they would no longer allow users to buy and sell bitcoin on their platform. The company still uses Bitcoin in the background for settlement purposes, although they've now also integrated other blockchain solutions. Circle users can also still use the platform as an effective bitcoin bank where the payments company stores bitcoins for them.\n\nAllaire has noted his frustration with what he perceives as the slow speed of development in Bitcoin on multiple occasions.

In recent comments to Bitcoin Magazine , an AlphaBay support representative claimed Monero currently accounts for 2 percent of the market's business. The support representative also claimed that Zcash (another privacy-focused altcoin) integration could make sense in the future.\n\nAlthough some blockchain enthusiasts are not fans of the darknet markets, the reality is that they still play a large enough role in the development of this technology to merit the number-four most widely read business story on Bitcoin Magazine this year, for a top 4 spot on our list.\n\n3: Deutsche Bank Understands Blockchain Technology's Disruptive Potential\n\nThe year 2016 is when banks became more serious than ever about blockchain technology, and a statement from Deutsche Bank illustrated this sentiment early in the year. In a statement from February, the bank was quoted as saying , \"Banks must partner with fintech and digital currency businesses or risk disappearing altogether.\"\n\nDeutsche Bank is one of the members of the R3 consortium that has been researching blockchain technology on behalf of the member banks. 2016 also saw the release of Corda , which is a distributed ledger created by the R3 consortium.\n\nAlthough Deutsche Bank mentioned digital currencies in their statement, the bank's focus with financial technology has been on creating more convenient banking and payment solutions for their customers.\n\nDeutsche Bank has been working on partnerships with various fintech startups over the course of 2016 in an effort to keep up with disruptive financial technologies.\n\n2: Gem Launches Health Network With Philips Blockchain Lab\n\nIn April, Gem announced the launch of Gem Health , which is a network for developing healthcare applications powered by the Ethereum blockchain.

Good luck getting any secrets to optimal hair care from Diskerud, who might have a few endorsement deals in the works.\n\n\"I could tell you, but I'd have to kill you,\" Diskerud joked. \"There's some different products I use and I won't reveal that yet, but there's different techniques to doing shampooing and conditioning.\"\n\nHome cooking\n\nDiskerud is not a fan of Norwegian delicacies (\"Those are too weird for me\"), but he's found a store in New York City to get some tastes from home, although he's yet to find better banana bread than his mother's.\n\n\"There's a Norwegian store in New York where I can get Norwegian caviar, which I love, and brown cheese, which is a Norwegian favorite,\" Diskerud said. \"I recommend it.\"\n\nLet's go Rangers\n\nGrowing up in Norway, Diskerud watched a lot of hockey on television. But it was nothing compared to his first live NHL game, two years ago at Madison Square Garden.\n\n\"I didn't think that was as cool as when I saw my first live hockey game, a [New York] Rangers game, which was incredible. I'm in love with hockey,\" Diskerud said. \"I try to go to games when I can.\"\n\nAlmost lost in translation for Diskerud: the Rangers fans' chant for Mats Zuccarello.\n\n\"I thought they were saying 'boo' and I was kind of getting mad at the people around me because, why are they booing him?\" Diskerud said. \"But then it took me a couple of seconds to realize they were saying \"Zuuuuuuc.\"\n\nFavorite player?\n\nLike many other Rangers fans, Diskerud calls Zuccarello, a fellow Norwegian, his favorite player. In fact, the two have developed a friendship since Diskerud arrived in New York.\n\n\"We went out for dinners and stuff and he's a really good guy,\" Diskerud said. \"It looks like the fans in New York love him to bits and pieces, and they should, because he's a great hockey player. They call him the Hobbit. I see, because he's smaller than everyone else \u2013 but it's a joy to watch him play hockey.\"\n\nWhat's in a name?\n\nDiskerud got his nickname \"Mix\" because he had so much energy in running around his house as a young child that he reminded his mother of a Mixmaster kitchen appliance.\n\nThe title Mixmaster has two different connotations. It can refer to a DJ and a cook. So can this Mix do either?\n\n\"I would say I'm good at picking songs, but to remix them? Probably not as good,\" Diskerud said. \"When it comes to cooking, my go-to dish would be oven-baked salmon in different spices.\"\n\nFavorite thing about NYC\n\nIn a city with its share of sporting events, theater, museums and restaurants, Diskerud has a lot to choose from when it comes to his enjoyment of New York City.

This attitude speaks to my general disdain and- let's face it- subtle aggression towards street-clogging cars, overly smug Prius drivers, and bloated \"crossover\" SUVs.\n\nIn addition to being cheaper, faster, sexier, and (I am wholly and utterly convinced) safer than 4-wheeled \"cages\", motorcycles are genuinely greener than conventional cars, requiring fewer materials to make, ship, and maintain than most (all?) cars- even green ones! In addition, they're almost always a more fuel-efficient way to shuttle environmentally conscious commuters who aren't afraid to get a little wet every now and again to and from work, school, and- with the right luggage and smart shopping- even the grocery store.\n\nFor 2015, we've been cursed with goodness on all sides when it comes to fuel-efficient motorcycles.

That said, this list of is sort of informally divided up into categories, so there's no \"winner\" here- they're all winners! Shall we get started, then? Here is Gas 2's semi-official list of the 11 best fuel-efficient motorcycles you'll be able to buy in 2015. Enjoy!\n\n2015 Honda Grom 125 | 103.5 MPG\n\nCity Bike\n\nRemember that part where I said there was no winner? The Honda Grom 125 comes real close to making me ignore that nonsense- and why shouldn't it? Honda's best-selling, 50 MPH new-age monkey bike is utter bats*** insanity wrapped around a solid, reliable 125cc Honda dirt bike engine that won't leave you stranded. It's lightweight, small enough to sneak onto the bike lane without attracting too much negative attention, and good for 103.5 MPG in real-world conditions, according to MPG crowd-sourcing site, Fuelly.\n\n2015 Motoped Pro | 100 \"ish\" MPG\n\nMoped\n\nIf there's a better bike to blast across the bumper-to-bumper, rush-hour grind of major cities than a Honda Grom, it might be the Motoped Pro. Built and spec'ed by you, the Motoped client, you can go for the BMX-inspired \"pro\" shown, above, or the more outdoorsy \"survival\" model meant to whisk you away from the city and deep into the forest primeval, where you'll be forced to face down hordes of flesh-eating zombies or, you know, glampers. Either way, you can't go wrong with the ultra-lightweight, full-size banzai experience the 100-ish MPG Motoped offers \u2026 and it, too, is powered by Honda.\n\n2015 Yamaha SR400 | 66 MPG\n\nStandard\n\nFew bikes on the market today capture the idea of the Universal Japanese Motorcycle (UJM) better than the Yamaha SR400. Launched earlier this year, the SR400 evokes classic Yamahas of the 1970s and early 80s in terms of look and feel, but modern brakes, suspension bits, and tires mean the new version is worlds ahead of the 1975-81 SR.\n\n2015 Yamaha Star Bolt | 51.6 MPG\n\nCruiser\n\nWhen considering a middleweight cruiser for this \"best fuel-efficient motorcycles\" list, Chris and I almost chose the new-for-2015 Indian Scout for this list. In the end, however, it wasn't the Indian or even the newest Harley-Davidson Street model that best captured what I think of as \"a modern American motorcycle\". It was this, the 51.6 MPG Yamaha Star Bolt.\n\nThe Yamaha's 942cc air-cooled V-Twin sounds like 'Murica, and the fit, finish, and look of the Bolt is absolutely pitch-perfect as a bobber. And, if Harley had smart product-planners working for them in Milwaukee, they'd shelve the shoddy-looking, wires-everywhere, Made in India \"Street\" lineup and license Bolts from Yamaha. The fact that the Bolt is about $2000 less than a comparable Harley, too, would mean Harley dealers would have plenty of \"H-D mark-up\" room.\n\n2015 Honda GoldWing Valkyrie | 35 MPG\n\nTouring / Big Cruiser\n\nThe 35 MPG fuel economy rating on the 2015 Honda Valkyrie may not seem impressive at first glance, but I can't think of anything faster that gets better mileage. When Honda announced the GoldWing-based Valkyrie last year, it was unlike anything else on the road. It's still unlike anything else on the road- and it's still got a better power-to-weight ratio than Nissan"}

The Apis Cor and PIK companies have successfully completed the project which was announced in December 2016.\n\nHow it was built\n\nIn December 2016, the Apis Cor company in cooperation with PIK proceeded to print the building using a mobile 3D printer. Construction took place at the Apis Cor company's test facility in the town of Stupino, on the territory of the Stupino aerated concrete factory. Printing of self-bearing walls, partitions and building envelope were done in less than a day: pure machine time of printing amounted to 24 hours.\n\nAfter completing the wall structures, the printer was removed from the building with a crane-manipulator.\n\nThe area of the printed building is 38 m\u00b2.\n\nFor the first time in the Russian construction practice a house was printed as a whole, rather than assembled from pre-printed panels.\n\nDesign of the single-story residential house is rather unusual. This project was selected specifically, as one of the main purposes of this construction is to demonstrate the flexibility of equipment and diversity of available forms. The house can be of any shape, including the familiar square shape, because the additive technology has no restrictions on design of new buildings, except for the laws of physics. It means it's time to talk about the new fantastic potential of architectural solutions.\n\nThe house was erected in the coldest time of the year. Winter has added complexity to the project participants, as the use of concrete mixture, that is used as the printing \u00abink\u00bb, is only possible at temperatures above 5\u00b0 C. Although, the equipment itself is able to operate in temperatures down to minus 35\u00b0 C. The problem was solved by setting up a tent which provided the required temperature.\n\nSoon, using new materials, such as geopolymer, you will be able to print a house at any time of the year.\n\nWho helped\n\nThe developer of the unique equipment, Apis Cor, approached the matter of erecting the house throughly and invited five companies as partners, known for their innovative approaches.\n\nPIK companies group\n\nThe leading Russian public developer. Included in the list of strategic enterprises of Russian economy.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd\n\nOne of the largest manufacturers of high-tech components, telecommunications equipment, household appliances, audio and video equipment. The company changes traditional ideas of TVs, smart phones, wearable devices, tablets, cameras, household appliances, medical devices, network systems, semiconductors and LED solutions.\n\nSpecially for the demonstration house in Stupino, Samsung Electronics Corporation provided high-tech appliances, including a TV set with the same radius of curvature as a curved wall in the house.\n\nTechnoNICOL Corporation\n\nOne of the largest international manufacturers of reliable and efficient building materials. Operating in the market since the year 1992, the company has gained significant experience in the manufacture of roofing materials, hydro-acoustic and thermal insulation, as well as solutions for the transportation and road construction. TechnoNICOL offers the latest products and technologies on market, combining global experience and developments of their own research centers. Cooperation with design institutes and architectural workshops enable the corporation to flexibly and quickly respond to changes in consumer needs.\n\nFor this project TechnoNICOL Corporation has developed innovative solutions in the field of insulation of building structures that allows to maximize the benefits of 3D printing and can later become an integral part of the 3D construction. They are notable for technical efficiency and assembly speed, suitability for non-standard architectural designs and high performance. In the future these processes, most likely, will be automated.\n\nBitex Reibeputz Company\n\nA German company, which, for more than 50 years, has been leading a traditional family business in the field of development, production and marketing of paint and reinforcement materials. For many years the company has accumulated vast professional experience and is a reliable partner for trade construction networks, architects and building companies.\n\nBITEX provided unique finishing materials for the project : mineral decorative plaster Reibeputz \u2014 KOROED with high adhesion and vapor permeability and fa\u00e7ade paint Egalisationsfarbe, durable and resistant to weather conditions.\n\n\u00abFabrika Okon\u00bb company\n\nManufacturer of innovative thermo-windows with climate control.\n\nUnder cooperation terms provided double-glazed windows for installation in house printed using Apis Cor technology.\n\nSix companies have joined together to implement the project and demonstrate how successful could a symbiosis of high technologies be.

{"id": 259671, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "It is apparent in the history of most art forms that there is an illicit attraction at the heart of fatality which, at times, renders the artist nearly deaf to other subjects. Themes of death, the void, and general absence emerge in different ways in literature and poetry\u2013and not always through the words themselves, but in the negative spaces those words attempt to delineate. Charles Baudelaire, St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9 and Maurice Blanchot are three writers who, in their accelerating gravitation towards these themes, found themselves approaching them from angles now thought to be revolutionary or uniquely poignant. Baudelaire's insistent wallowing in his own misery draped a heavy cloud of his desire for nothingness and absence over many of his poems, effectively producing a repetitious but intoxicating thematic consistency. And while Baudelaire's work enacted the ambiance of death weighing down upon him in the content of his work, Mallarm\u00e9 arguably created a more revolutionary way of pleading with his obsessions through the form of his magnum opus \"Un Coup de D\u00e9s\", which plays with absence and the void physically through the empty space on the page itself. Blanchot takes a more direct philosophical approach to his own infatuation with death, comparing distinct perspectives on suicide, art and the nature of death in his essay \"Death as Possibility\". While all three writers had a consuming preoccupation with death and exhibited it in different ways, they all had a method of illuminating death and absence not always by addressing it directly, but by way of averted vision: mapping the boundaries of it with their language in order to inhabit a liminality that offered them a heightened state of wakefulness to both death and life.\n\nIn Baudelaire's Les Fleurs du Mal there is a poem called \"The Taste for Nothing\" (The Flowers of Evil, p. 102) which illustrates the craft of Baudelaire's ethereal language as well as his unclenching fascination with absence. In \"The Taste for Nothing\" he writes of being abandoned by hope and love, and the ever-present yearning for absence emerges\u2013as it does in many of Baudelaire's other poems. What is perhaps most common across Baudelaire's exploration of absence in his work is his full longing for sleep and numbness. He writes, \"Resign yourself, my heart; sleep your brutish sleep.\" It is well known that Baudelaire (along with many others of his time) was an opiate user and an alcoholic, and his apparent resignation to what could be called the transient voids of sleep and anesthetizing agents should come as no surprise as a theme in his work. There seems to be a dominant motif of wanting time to pass without having to experience it\u2013to exist not as a participant of time (which, to Baudelaire, was at times nothing but an involuntary exercise in suffering), nor even as an observer of it, but as one who wholly denied it. In the same poem, Baudelaire writes, \"And Time, minute by minute engulfs me, like heavy snow around a stiffening body\u2026\" Sleep and drugs were perhaps Baudelaire's best attempts at becoming immaterial enough for an artificial unity with true absence, a way of averting his painful experience with time and space while not permanently abandoning them in real resignation. Not unexpectedly, then, does Baudelaire's diction in much of his work mimic his longing for ethereality.\n\nIn contrast to Baudelaire's diction invoking absence is Mallarm\u00e9's poem \"Un Coup de D\u00e9s\", which labors the theme not only in the words chosen, but in the disparate placement of those words on the page. A highly experimental piece considering its time, \"Un Coup de D\u00e9s\" acts almost as a frame, born of language, to border the concept of absence, void, or, in Mallarm\u00e9's term, \"the Abyss\". He describes it as \"blanched/spread/furious/beneath and incline/desperately plane\u2026\" (Collected Poems, p. 128). But it is not only (or even primarily) the words chosen here to describe Mallarm\u00e9's Abyss that enact a sense of peering into it\u2013it is their arrangement on the page. The words themselves effect the qualities they project in that they leave a surfeit of empty space beneath them as they decline in a layered movement across the page. While this sequence is more linearly organized than some of the other sequences in \"Un Coup de D\u00e9s\", it is also undeniably disorienting through the not-so-logical progression of its actual content. Mallarm\u00e9 invented a kind of topographical formation in \"Un Coup de D\u00e9s\" through different sized text that necessitates the reciprocal invention of a new way of reading. In this sense, he invokes the Abyss (the unutterable) by breaching one's trust"}

An adverse ruling could result in disbarment. He is already facing criminal charges stemming from claims that he misled investors in another job before he took office.\n\nPaxton issued an opinion in June that pretty much told county clerks that they could ignore the high court's ruling if they were acting on their religious beliefs.\n\nMost of the media reports said clerks who were initially reluctant \u2014 or confused \u2014 after the ruling were awaiting legal guidance. Paxton gave it to them, warning them, however, that because each case differs, they might face fines and other legal actions for following his sage counsel. In other words, go ahead and do it, but be prepared for legal consequences.\n\nAt the time, I thought the top legal guy in the state was telling public officials that they don't have to follow the law, though couching it in fail-safe language.

Abbott was telling his state agencies that no public employee should be sanctioned if that employee was acting on religious beliefs.\n\nThe State Bar can't comment on specific, pending disciplinary cases. So, to determine which parts might have been violated, let's go directly to the code.\n\nA section about \"misleading legal argument\" states a pretty basic notion: \"Legal argument based on a knowingly false representation of the law constitutes dishonesty.\"\n\nBut this appears to cover matters being adjudicated, and Abbott and Paxton can say that \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 good-faith differences of legal opinion do not constitute misleading argument.\n\nThere is a portion of the code that says, \"a lawyer shall not willfully, in connection with an adjudicatory proceeding \u2026 manifest by words or conduct, bias or prejudice based on race, color, national origin, religion, disability, age, sex, or sexual orientation towards any person involved in that proceeding in any capacity.\"\n\nThere's \"adjudicatory\" again. And Abbott and Paxton were saying they were fighting bias \u2014 against people of faith. But I've not seen opinions from them that public employees, on account of their religion, can deny services because someone is, say, divorced or \"living in sin\" or an atheist, practices a faith in which Allah and the Prophet are central (except if it's a matter of refusing them entry as refugees), or had an abortion or wants birth control through Medicaid funds. Seems clear: Their target was specifically gay people. Everyone else gets a marriage license.\n\nBut, perhaps, the provision that might fit best when pondering whether the two violated the code: A lawyer shall not \"engage in conduct constituting obstruction of justice.\"\n\nThe highest court in the land had just legalized gay marriage, and the Texas governor and attorney general were pretty much urging public employees to ignore that. They argued that religious beliefs (separation of church and state, anyone?) trumped the ruling.\n\nThat sounds like obstruction \u2014 and a slippery slope.\n\nSo, can a public employee who is an atheist deny a marriage license to a couple because the vows will take place in a church? No, that would be demonstrating clear hostility toward religion \u2014 just as denying marriage licenses expresses hostility toward same-sex couples.\n\nAfter the ruling, Abbott said, \"No Texan is required by the Supreme Court's decision to act contrary to his or her religious beliefs regarding marriage.\"\n\nSo, if Paxton merits investigation, arguably, so does Abbott.\n\nOpening the door for public employees to deny marriage licenses to same-sex couples stands out as a clear indicator of anti-gay bias, and this is no more palatable coming from a churchgoer than from a"}

{"id": 259678, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Today we announce Trelby. This post documents how it came about, from my perspective.\n\nThe Backstory\n\nAround mid-2011, when I decided to make a film, I went around searching for a simple, free, multiplatform screenwriting software. Note the three adjectives.\n\nAs an Ubuntu user, I needed something multiplatform. I did not want to switch my OS just to write a screenplay.\n\nI needed a program that would be fast and easy to use. Hey, I like bells and whistles as much as the next person, but a screenwriter also needs to get out of your way and let you write.\n\nAnd I'm an free software enthusiast. I like the freedom of being able to tinker with my software, of not having to wait for the BIGCORP, INC overlords to deign my feature request worthy of attention.\n\nThe Past\n\nSo, I went around on a google hunt. And the software that came the closest? Celtx.\n\nCeltx is pretty good. It is multiplatform. It's free, and it has a lot of bells and whistles.\n\nIt's good enough that I wrote my first film with it.\n\nBut celtx was never simple. It had quirks. It did not look right. It provided limited configurablily of the interface. It called itself open source, but the build-sauce was difficult, and you needed to jump through hoops to work on it. It was tied to the company's services. PDF functionality wasn't built into the software! It was on a remote server, so you had to have an internet connection to generate a PDF.. I never understood that! And I could not disable the distracting bottom bar, that always showed the latest news update and things.\n\nAnd it grew slooowww. Longer screenplays would start crawling. The editor would update in jerks, like you were magically typing words, and not letters. Granted I use a netbook, but a screenwriter is just a text editor! It should not require a supercomputer to run properly.\n\nBeing a little disappointed with this option, I searched for others.\n\nThere were none. Final Draft seemed to be the \"standard\" but it cost a lot. (And I mean a LOT).\n\nThe search did lead me to many tiny little gems. The most memorable one was called Pago. A vim script, that modified vim into a screenwriter. I now had fast and multiplatform. But not simple. Pago only had the (limited) intelligence to format the text to screenplay style, but that was it. However, it had one thing over Celtx - simple offline PDF generation. And I had settled on Pago for my then screenwriting needs.\n\nSo I forked a project on Github, and created a Pago repository. And while I was on github.. why not search for \"screenwriting\". With the thousands of project on there, perhaps there would be some other Pago like tiny solutions.\n\nAnd so I discovered Blyte. \"Chanced\" might be a better word. Talk about hitting gold.\n\nYears ago Osku Salerma had entered the fray of screenwriting software, creating a very well written piece of free, simple, multiplatform software. But it's revenue stream did not justify the time spent on it, and it was killed. Thankfully, it was made open. Osku created the github repository, and pushed the code in. This code has since been in hibernation.\n\nBlyte had not show up on my extensive google searches. I suspect it hadn't in Kent Tessman's searches either, who grew tired of the incumbent playing field as well, and set out to create Fade In Pro, which is multiplatform and simple, but not free!\n\nThe Present\n\nIn October, I started working on Blyte. It was written in python! I installed the wxpython libraries, and ran the program, wondering how a five year old codebase would've aged.\n\n(beat)\n\nIt worked! the colors looked odd, the interface seemed a little clunky, and the ancient widget library did not look great on Ubuntu.\n\nBut it ran without issues. And it was good. It had full PDF support (including font embedding). It was lightning fast. It was configurable. It had a tiny little fancy features too.\n\nAnd the big three-adjective hole in free software was filled. I got in touch with Osku, who had not looked at Blyte in years, but enthusiastically agreed to take up maintaining Blyte's modern fork: Trelby. (it took a while to settle on a name!)\n\nThe Future\n\nTrelby is polished Blyte, with many (many!) additional features, a clean uncluttered interface,"}

Such anthropomorphizing is a good approximation for corporations, since they make considerable efforts to make the approximation true \u2013 by concentrating all power in the CEO, and then delegating power from the CEO.\n\nHowever, the cathedral is rather a bunch of conspiracies, and its direction is determined by entropic forces akin to enthalpy, rather than a sinister and clever plan. To build a ruling coalition, divide power into bite sized morsels and distribute widely. Not a good plan for operating a functional organization. Mann is sovereign, and Mann is an idiot.\n\nIn Europe you go directly to jail for thought crimes. The US has the first amendment, so employs a workaround. If a business employs thought criminals, it has a \"hostile work environment\", so gets sued by social justice warriors, and has to pay them large sums, making thought criminals effectively unemployable, and social justice an obscenely lucrative career option.\n\nThis, however, does not work on open source, hence Gamergate is relatively successful. The Social Justice Warriors attempt to seize open source projects. Sometimes they seize them, and to their surprise destroy them, often they get pushback, which pushback they attribute to Gamergate and the Neoreaction. And indeed it is true, in that Gamergate and the Neoreaction is the think tank of the pushback, but what makes the pushback effective is the propensity of the revolution to devour its children, what makes the pushback effective is that leftists pretty soon start persecuting leftists for insufficient holiness, with the result that pious leftists find themselves, to their horror, deep shame, and great embarrassment, joining forces with Gamergate and the Neoreaction in self defense, as the Montagnards found themselves collaborating with the Dantonists.\n\nThere is always a state religion. There never was a golden age of freedom of speech and thought. However if you have many states with many state religions, and there is a lot of movement and communication between them, as in America before the civil war, then truth stands a chance, because if the gentleman from Massachusetts cannot say the truth, the gentleman from Virginia can say it, because before the Mormon War and the Civil War, the State of Virginia had a different and independent state religion from the state of Massachusetts.\n\nThe religion of Massachusets wound up conquering the US, and eventually the world, in large part because Virginia took religious freedom seriously, while Harvard and Massachusetts was unyieldingly and fanatically determined to extirpate it with fire and steel and still are unyieldingly and fanatically determined to extirpate it with fire and steel. When crazies and fanatics go up against moderate, compromising, and cynical cosmopolitans, the moderate and cynical cosmopolitans tend to get trampled.\n\nIf ever there was freedom from the state religion in a white state, that state was Virginia before the War between the States, and it did not end well.\n\nWe today have two problems: A single monolithic state religion, that since World War II has dominated the entire world, and a state religion with no archbishop and inquisition to keep the crazies in line. Kings put Bishops on the payroll to shut up the crazies. If you have a state religion controlled by the holiest, you get holiness spirals of ever more holy people\n\nHaving freedom would be the cure, but freedom within a single state is tricky, and, as we saw in Virginia, vulnerable to violence from the holy. Whites are prone to state religions. Asymmetric repression leads to movement ever leftwards. The state religion has to repress the excessively holy as well as the insufficiently holy, or it inevitably gets ever crazier.\n\nIf freedom for the insufficiently holy is hard to achieve, restricting the liberty of the excessively holy is easy to achieve.\n\nWhite nationalists tend to mistake repressing the excessively holy, controlling the priesthood, for controlling the Jews. Effective measures to keep the priesthood and the excessively holy in line would quite disproportionately affect Jews, but Jews as such are the wrong target."}

They just don't agree with us on the issue of marriage.\" (SPLC has never claimed that Liberty Counsel or its anti-LGBTQ allies are \"violent organizations.\")\n\nWhen the host of the program, Jim Schneider, asked how far the nation would let this sort of thing go, Staver issued a dire warning.\n\n\"I think that's a question that everyone listening here needs to answer,\" he said, \"I think we've crossed the line and we can't let this go any further. We've got to push back, it cannot happen like this. You know, if you go back into the 1930s, what ultimately happened back then with the Jews\u2014and history, you know, there's other histories you can point to\u2014but they began to ultimately ban Jews from public employment, then ban Jews from their private employment, then put a Star of David on their ID and a Star of David on their passport, restrict their travel, restrict their income opportunity, and eventually you know what happened, we had to fight a World War II over that issue.\"\n\n(Speaking of travel restrictions, Staver went on the radio to defend President Trump's travel ban for residents of several Muslim-majority nations earlier this year.)\n\nLater in the interview, Staver lamented the \"coarsening of discourse and a lack of morals and integrity\" in American political debates, which he chalked up to \"the erosion of our Judeo-Christian values\" and what he claimed is intolerance of dissent.\n\n\"That is so much different than anything we've ever had before,\" he said, \"and continuing on this way, I think it's almost, it's like a civil war against our values, it's a war against the very essence of who we are.\"\n\nHe continued: \"And there's a number, like Antifa, that's an anarchist group, they call themselves anarchists. I mean, an anarchist is somebody who wants to create anarchy, this is to just to completely destroy all the institutions. And you see this happening with the monuments. You know, I understand the concern people have against the Confederate monuments, I get all that, I understand that, I have a lot of people, a lot of friends that are affected by that. On the other hand, I have a lot of friends who say, 'Look, this is part of our history.'\"\n\nHe added that \"if we want to start taking down our history, our monuments, because certain people were not at the same level that we want them to be today\" the only monuments that would remain would be those of Jesus Christ."}

When you're at the store fill up the van's tank and both of the canisters. From the store, make sure you buy everything from the left wall. The fan belt, multiple canisters of each fluids. They will be important for building and starting the engine for the first time, so don't be afraid to spend almost 3,000 mk.\n\nBelow you will find a recommended shopping list for your first trip to Teimo's Shop:\n\n\u2191 Depends on route and driving skills.\n\nNote: If saving at the store; save before doing the shopping, as the shopping bag will open upon reloading the game.\n\nStarting the van\n\nTo start and drive the van, get in by jumping into the seat (you should automatically crouch when entering the cab of any vehicle). Start the van by left clicking on the ignition (left side of steering wheel), then wait for the glow plug indicator to turn off before clicking and holding down to crank the engine. The same procedure applies to other diesel engines in the game. Headlights are to the left of the radio near the gearshift. Disengage the handbrake by holding right click, do it again if the parking brake indicator is still on.\n\nMake sure you turn off H-shifter at the main menu if you're using a gamepad or keyboard and mouse. By default; X is clutch, G to shift up, B to shift down.\n\nFinding the store\n\nTo find the store, head right down the dirt road from your house and keep taking right turns until you find the store, the shortcuts through the lake are no longer viable, but an alternative route that is longer, but sometimes faster is to turn left and then turn right twice, and then take the second intersection, allowing you to drive more on the asphalt road.\n\nEating and drinking\n\nTo drink beer and eat food, look at the beer/food and press the action button (default F ). You can also drink from the kitchen or bathroom tap by turning the tap on, then crouching next to it (default Q ).\n\nMaking money\n\nTo make money, there is a barn to the right down the road from your house. Inside is a chopping block and an axe which you can use to make money. Click the log stack to put a log on the chopping block. Click the axe, hit action button (default F ), then right click to swing.\n\nThere is also a tractor in the barn. You can use this to tow your car by driving the tractor near it, then left clicking a tow hitch. Left click again to disconnect. You can also use the forklift to pick up your car using the front hydraulics lever from the right side of drivers seat. Don't lower it too far or it will glitch up the tractor.\n\nSaving the game\n\nTo save your game, go to the nearest toilet and select \"Save & Quit\"\n\nIf you damage the body of your car, you can repair it by doing the following:\n\nNavigate to C:\\Users\\Username\\AppData\\LocalLow\\Amistech\\My Summer Car .\n\n.

For them, it's usually good enough to know that when grown-ups love each other very much and want to be a family together, they get often get married. There's no need to discuss the tax implications or workplace benefits or hospital visitation rights with a three-year-old. But is it necessary to limit the concept to the traditional one-man-one-woman definition just because you're talking to a three-year-old? Even if you, personally, are okay with the idea of same-sex marriage? Even if you live in a country where same-sex marriage is legal? Lisa van de Geyn, writing in Today's Parent, seems to think so, because talking about same-sex marriage is hard.\n\n\nWhen the subject of marriage came up between her and her three-year-old daughter \u2014 after Mrs. van de Geyn suggested that the cartoon character Handy Manny ought to marry his friend Kelly \u2014 she laid down the law on same-sex marriage: \"Girls don't marry other girls. Girls marry boys and boys marry girls.\"\n\nShe goes on to say that it's not a religious or political matter for her, or even her own personal beliefs, but instead that the \"conversation totally came out of left field\" and she simply wasn't ready for it. Now, I'm not going to fault her for panicking and saying the wrong thing when she was put on the line by her kid \u2014 the girl asked if Handy Manny and Mr. Lopart should get married \u2014 even though she did bring up the topic. She could, very easily, revisit the subject, letting her daughter know that she made a mistake and that boys can indeed marry boys. Instead, it's what she said at the end of her article that I want to call her out on.\n\nMrs. van de Geyn ends her piece by saying that \"I don't regret telling her that boys marry girls and girls marry boys. I don't feel it's a topic appropriate for her age.\" Why isn't same-sex marriage a suitable topic for a three-year-old? I can understand not wanting to discuss, for example, the use of bondage for sexual gratification or the meaning of the word santorum, but same-sex marriage is a problem? Seriously?\n\nWhat Mrs. van de Geyn is really saying is that boy-girl marriage is okay but boy-boy or girl-girl marriage is icky-poo-poo. And that's not an okay message for parents to tell their kids.\n\nThere have been far too many suicides and murders because of this precise point of view to let it continue for another generation. There are far too many wonderful people being treated like second-class citizens to let this go. There are too many loving couples who can't legally say \"I do\" because of people who feel this way. You don't get to perpetuate bigotry simply because talking to your kids makes you uncomfortable. If you have kids, you have to deal with the difficult stuff along with the cute stuff. You can't weasel out of it at someone else's expense.\n\nIn her article, Mrs. van de Geyn asks \"what would you have told your kid?\" and my answer is what I have already told my three-year-old \u2014 that marriage is when people love each other very much and want to become a family, they may choose to get married. That way, they know what's important about marriage \u2014 love. There are no judgments, no limitations, no prerequisites, other than love. What matters is what's inside. That's a lesson it seems some adults need to learn as well.\n\nTags: civil rights, discrimination, equality, freedom, gay, gay marriage, glbt, lgbt, marriage, marriage equality, prop8, talking, toddlers"}

This update will also reportedly bring the newest TouchWiz version and updates to Samsung apps.\n\nIn addition to the new Android 4.3 features and Galaxy Note 3 features this update will bring support for the Samsung Galaxy Gear smart watch that Samsung announced at the Unpacked event with the Galaxy Note 3. This smart watch will then be able to connect to a Galaxy Note 2 and act as a bluetooth headset on your wrist, sync photos and alerts to the Galaxy Note 2 and should be able to use the Smart Relay feature which allows an email being read on the wrist to show up on the Galaxy Note when it is unlocked.\n\nIf the official Android 4.3 update for the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 doesn't arrive until December for the first devices this could mean an even longer wait for carrier specific versions of the Android 4.3 update which will need to pass additional testing and go through added customizations.

However, realising that the media was also scrutinizing the backlash, many of those who posted abusive tweets deleted them to destroy any evidence. The bullying wasn't limited to tweets though. A fake email account was created on her name and inappropriate emails were sent out from that account.\n\nDinakaran confess that she had never been subjected to hate in such a heinous manner and all the abuses and personal attack made her extremely paranoid. \"Sure, you might think they were empty threats, and I really had nothing to worry about. But did you forget about the episode where the two girls got arrested over an innocent Facebook status? I was paranoid,\" writes Dinakaran in her blog post.\n\n\"I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat. I didn't leave my house for a good ten days, I'm not even kidding you. My face was everywhere, and it only took one crazy person to act in a deranged manner to do something if I was easily recognizable in public. I wouldn't rest until my family was back home in the evenings. I was checking up with my friends (whose pictures with me were on Facebook) whether they were alright. I asked friends who were rallying with me on social media channels to stop doing so, in case they became victims of this callousness,\" she writes.\n\nDinakaran also says that she is not a SRK hater and the intention of her blog post wasn't to malign him, but to merely point out similarities. It's worth keeping in mind that the negativity of social media drove Shah Rukh Khan to delete his Twitter account at one point. \"Sad, i read so much judgements, jingoism, religious intolerance on the net & i use to think this platform wl change narrowmindedness, but no!\" Khan had written just before deleting his twitter account.\n\n\"Bullying's latest avatar is cyberbullying.\" Dinakaran points out on her blog. \"It's mind numbingly easy to form groups and target people on the internet and bully them mercilessly. It's a collective effort, yes, effort, and that means actual work that these bullies put in to intentionally hurt the victims. This includes anything and everything from spamming the user's walls, creating fake email ID's, harassing the user online, gathering information about them and try to use it against them.\" she adds.\n\nIn India, cyber bullying gets the necessary go-ahead from the absence of laws attuned to such cases. Most cases of online abuse are dealt by clubbing Section 66A with the Prohibition of Ragging Act (Section 509 of IPC), which is meant to tackle sexual harassment. Except for Section 66A of the IT Act, according to which a person can be booked for sending false, offensive messages through communication services, there is no strong law to tackle cases of online abuse.\n\nUpdated Date: Oct 25, 2013 17:24 PM"}

So we wanted to fact-check her claim that temperature readings \"have been fabricated.\" We reached out to Perino to find the source of her statement and did not hear back. However, a couple of days before she spoke, the British paper The Telegraph carried an opinion piece entitled, \"The fiddling with temperature data is the biggest science scandal ever.\"\n\nI, of course covered this last week \u2013 but let's recap.\n\nNot long ago, Paul Homewood, a blogger that Fox News itself describes as \"retired accountant, blogger, and self described \"climate historian\"' (that certainly inspires confidence) \u2013 posted that he had looked at data from several stations in Paraguay, and that those temperatures had been \"adjusted\" to bias them toward warming. Rabidly right wing columnist Christopher Booker of the Telegraph newspaper picked this slim reed up and declared it the \"Biggest Science Scandal Ever\".\n\nCue the right wing echo chamber. Here's one thing that the climate denialist right wing does well. They don't have many thoughts, but the ones they do have, they repeat and amplify endlessly.\n\n\nThis tactic worked well a few years ago when deployed in the so-called \"climate gate\" non-scandal, and managed to snooker a number of unwary mainstream media outlets into parroting Limbaugh-esque talking points that confused a lot of people, for a while.\n\nSince then, scientists, and pro-science communicators, have formed a number of alliances \u2013 mail groups, blogs, personal and professional networks, and rapid-response teams to bat down disinformation as soon as it starts to circulate, and a certain amount of awareness building has taken place in the mainstream media. It helped that the \"climate gate\" nonsense turned out to be a hoax of WMD proportions.\n\nThe reason this latest kerfuffle has been confined mostly to the Fox News Noise machine and the denial blogosphere speaks to the effectiveness of the science counter measures.\n\nIt also speaks to the fact that in the last few years, the Planet itself has been weighing in heavily on the debate. More and more, climate denial talking points end up orbiting in ever tighter circles in the hermetically sealed, impenetrable logic loop of the conspiracy set.\n\nTo sum up \u2013 yes, adustments are made in data. They can be because a station has moved, or perhaps because a city has grown up around a rural station, or because the daily measuring time has been changed at some point. Sometimes adjustments push temperature trends up, and sometimes down.\n\nOver the long haul, they've been a wash.\n\nFactcheck.org:\n\nNOAA maintains about 1,500 monitoring stations, and accumulates data from more than a thousand other stations in countries around the world (many national and international organizations share this type of data freely). There are actually fewer monitoring stations today than there used to be; modern stations have better technology and are accessible in real time, unlike some older outposts no longer in use. The raw, unadjusted data from these stations is available from many sources, including the international collaboration known as the Global Historical Climatology Network and others. As the years go by, all those stations undergo various types of changes: This can include shifts in how monitoring is done, improvements in technology, or even just the addition or subtraction of nearby buildings. For example, a new building constructed next to a monitoring station could cast a shadow over a station, or change wind patterns, in such ways that could affect the readings. Also, the timing of temperature measurements has varied over time. And in the 1980s, most U.S. stations switched from liquid-in-glass to electronic resistance thermometers, which could both cool maximum temperature readings and warm minimum readings. Monitoring organizations like NOAA use data from other stations nearby to try and adjust for these types of issues, either raising or lowering the temperature readings for a given station. This is known as homogenization. The most significant adjustment around the world, according to NOAA, is actually for temperatures taken over the oceans, and that adjustment acts to lower rather than raise the global temperature trend.\n\nPolitifact again:\n\nEvery month, readings from thousands of land-based weather"}

Everyone looks so different,\" said one contestant of Indian origin, Kelsey Rabindran.\n\nBut when it comes to the ultimate standard of beauty, Malaysia still can't seem to help looking west. The last three winners of the local pageant have been Eurasians.\n\nThat prompted the International Business Times to run an article on Malaysian beauty ideals headlined: \"The politics of beauty: Is Malaysia's Miss Universe contestant too white?\"\n\nFair skin makes features stand out and you look more flawless\n\nThe article in the US publication focused on the appearance of reigning Miss Universe Malaysia Kimberley Leggett, describing her as \"75 per cent white\".\n\nThe Miss Universe Malaysia Organisation has strongly criticised the suggestion.\n\n\"You can't discriminate against a girl with western looks who is Malaysian from taking part,\" said national director Andrea Fonseka, who is herself Eurasian. \"It was done fair and square. Even the public was part of the voting last year.\"\n\nIt is tough to choose a Miss Universe Malaysia who reflects most of Malaysian women.\n\nThat's because Malay-Muslims make up over half of the country's 29 million population, but are banned from participating in beauty pageants because of a 1995 fatwa.\n\n\"We have Muslim girls who are unaware of this fatwa asking to compete, but we had to turn them away,\" said Ms Fonseka.\n\nThat's why Eurasians seem to be over-represented in the competition, she said.\n\nBut a general bias towards fairer skin in the former British colony is clear. Flip through any local newspapers and advertising campaigns often show white or Eurasian models.\n\nIn the latest offering from the Asian satellite channel Diva Universal, two-thirds of the men featured in the show Hot Guys Who Can Cook are Eurasians.\n\nIt's also difficult to find skin products that do not contain ingredients that whiten.\n\nBut it's not simply because Malaysians want to look like white people, said Sarah Jade Schipper, a Miss Universe Malaysia 2013 finalist who is of Malaysian Chinese and Dutch heritage.\n\n\"Fair skin makes features stand out and you look more flawless,\" she said.\n\nBut her rival for the title, Naomi Chandrasegar, 24, said Malaysians were exposed to a steady cultural diet of Hollywood movies and Eurasian beauties on the front of magazines. \"We are conditioned to want to look like them,\" she said.\n\nThe prominence of western standards of beauty may also be motivated by local brands wanting to appear more international.\n\nIt's true for a new cosmetic surgery clinic in Kuala Lumpur.

But the most common surgery requested by his local patients is a nose job.\n\nThat's because the noses of many Malaysian Malays, Chinese or Indians are flat and wide, said Dr Nasir. \"Somehow it becomes a gold standard that a nice nose should be like a western nose, with a high bridge, sharp tip, narrow nostrils,\" he added.\n\nBut there are small signs of change.

Goldman and other banks have retooled their analyst programs, including new measures to outsource grunt work and invest in timesaving technology. Credit Suisse Group AG has begun putting early-career bankers in front of clients soon after hiring\u2014something that might have taken years in another era on Wall Street. The Swiss bank also appointed a program director to coach senior bankers on communicating with young staffers, providing tips such as \"don't lean on hierarchy,\" says Amy Hudson, chief operating officer of the firm's investment bank and capital-markets division. The appointee, Nancy Nightingale, is a \"total mom figure,\" says one third-year analyst. She recently helped shepherd an effort to get bosses to send personal emails highlighting junior bankers' individual achievements. \"The things that [young workers] want are frankly the things that all of us always wanted,\" says Ms. Hudson. But today's junior bankers, she says, are \"more confident about expressing it in the workplace.\" That dynamic isn't unique to finance. Only 28% of millennials feel their current employer is making full use of their skills, according to a survey by Deloitte & Touche LLP. On Wall Street, however, paying one's dues has long been part of the culture. Michelle Wu discovered that fact six months into her job as a credit analyst at Goldman Sachs when she sought a transfer to another group to learn new skills. Her team mentors turned her down, she says. \"Their responses were, 'Keep your head down' and 'Focus on your work,' \" she recalls. Goldman declined to comment on specific employees. In December 2014, after less than a year at Goldman, she accepted a job on Google's small-business team and moved to California. Despite working more than 100 hours a week\u2014about the same as her job at the bank\u2014Ms. Wu says she feels more energized. When she told her boss about an opportunity to increase revenue, she says, he told her to \"run with it.\" Wall Street's postcrisis landscape has been reshaped by job cuts and reduced risk-taking, and pay packages don't tip the scales like they used to. At three elite business schools\u2014Harvard University, Stanford University and University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School\u2014M.B.A. graduates who accepted jobs in investment banking or trading had a first-year base salary of $125,000, on average, similar to those who join technology companies, and less than the roughly $150,000 base at other Wall Street firms such as hedge funds and private-equity firms, according to the schools. Surveys show that young people who came of age during the economic downturn are less trusting of the financial sector in general, and more eager to find jobs that they believe serve a social good. A 2014 Brookings Institution report concluded that millennials are likely to \"find an outlet for their desire to change the world for the better somewhere other than on Wall Street.\" Some veteran executives say banks should do a better job of explaining how helping clients raise capital and manage their financial risks is good for society. Citigroup announced in March a program to allow incoming analysts to spend a year at nonprofits before beginning their banking careers. Citigroup will pay them 60% of their starting salary during that time. Nine recruits already have signed on. The bank also introduced a program for young bankers to travel to Kenya for a four-week microfinance project, mirroring an initiative launched by Moelis earlier in the year. Moelis employees who have been with the firm for at least five years are entitled to a four-week paid sabbatical program, a spokeswoman said. Some young Wall Street bankers say initiatives to reduce long hours, however well-intentioned, are having unintended consequences. Analysts at Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan and other banks say mandatory days off have made it tough to spread out workloads, ramping up pressure when they are in the office. Analysts in a few Goldman groups say capping intern hours has undermined team dynamics and created tensions over division of work. Some bankers are baffled by the attitude of their more junior colleagues. There is a pain point among midlevel bankers who \"can sometimes get frustrated if the younger analyst isn't as available as they want them to be,\" says Mr. Waldron, Goldman"}

The grin on Kubiak's face looks as if it's been in place since winning Super Bowl 50 last season\u2014his first season as the Broncos' head coach.\n\nInstead of talking football X's and O's, Kubiak chooses this particularly cold spring morning to open up about the night he was brought to his knees by a TIA\u2014transient ischemic attack.\n\nThe mini-stroke occurred on Nov. 3, 2013, in front of a national television audience. Kubiak was head coach of the Houston Texans at the time. He was leaving the field with his team at then\u2013Reliant Stadium when he dropped suddenly to his knees.\n\nWithin minutes he was on a stretcher, being wheeled to a waiting ambulance. The Houston native was taken to Houston Methodist hospital, where it was confirmed through a series of tests that Kubiak had experienced a TIA. A TIA can occur when blood flow to part of the brain stops for a short period of time. It can mimic stroke-like symptoms and last less than 24 hours before disappearing.\n\n\"I don't recall a lot of what happened,'' says Kubiak, who turned 55 on Aug. 15. \"But what I do recall is after the fact. I remember being at the hospital, and they were putting me through MRIs, various things. I had some issues going on with my left side, which was scaring the hell out of me.\"\n\n\"So I'm going through all these things, and I remember them asking me and my family to sign papers okaying them to give me this shot. And my wife and kids were saying, 'You've got to do it.' That's when I realized something was going on.\" Luckily, doctors were able to administer a clotbusting thrombolytic drug, which if received in a timely manner can limit the potential damage caused by a stroke.\n\n\"I think after that, a couple days went by and I felt normal. But I knew I'd been through something that could have been life-threatening.\n\n\"I came to the realization that I was OK, but after what had taken place I'd better stop and listen. I had some issues going on, like weakness in my left arm and left leg. But I knew that I had weathered the storm, so to speak. I felt very fortunate that I was getting under control to get back to being myself.\"\n\nKubiak's interpretation of \"being myself\" meant returning to countless hours of work at the practice facility, watching game film of opponents, evaluating players' performances, and drawing up game plans. To say the National Football League has consumed his life would be an understatement. The 2016 season will be his 32nd in the league\u2014nine as a player (all with the Broncos) and 23 as a head coach or assistant.\n\nThe grind of countless hours of football was catching up to Kubiak when the TIA hit him with all the force of a blitzing linebacker leveling an unsuspecting quarterback.\n\nBeing the competitor that he is, Kubiak wanted to pick himself up off the ground and go back to work. Instead, he was advised to stay home and was given guidelines to follow while he slowly worked his way back to the team.\n\n\"They told me I'd find that I'd be pretty exhausted going through this situation,\" Kubiak says. \"That was the biggest thing for about two or three weeks. You know, being a football coach and waking up every day at 5 o'clock in the morning, going to work, and working until 10, 11 at night \u2026 you think you're a little invincible.\n\n\"All of a sudden I'm getting up and around the house\u2014I'd make it until noon and have to sit down. I knew something had changed about me, as far as my energy, and I had some work to do to get back to being myself.\"\n\nWhen Kubiak received clearance to return to the Texans, his time with the team didn't last long. After losing 27\u201320 to the Jacksonville Jaguars on Dec. 5, Houston's season record dropped to 2\u201311.\n\nThe Texans decided to fire Kubiak, bringing his eight-year tenure with the team to an abrupt end. \"So I went from worrying about my health to all of a sudden, shoot, I just got fired,\" Kubiak says. \"There was a lot going on.\"\n\nNot long after being fired, Kubiak took a weekend trip to Louisiana with his wife, Rhonda. The two have been married now for 33 years. The getaway might have"}

Hoping to avoid alarming her, Josey-Davis stopped what he was doing, placed his gun quietly into the glove box, and, having been \"distracted by a chain of events,\" quickly forgot all about it. Later that evening, while out for a drive with his girlfriend, he was pulled over for a minor traffic offense, at which point he volunteered to the officer that he had a loaded firearm in the front of the car, in violation of New Jersey's transportation rules. The pistol was confiscated, and, when he went to pick it up later in the week, he was arrested and charged with illegal possession \u2014 a second-degree felony.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf all the states in all the country, Steffon Josey-Davis had to screw up in this one.\n\nWhatever his intentions might have been, there is no question that Josey-Davis broke the law. In a recent interview with Fox News, he noted rather hopefully that his concealed-carry permit \"was due to be approved the week he was arrested.\" Perhaps this is true, and he would have received it shortly after. But it is also utterly irrelevant. If one needs a permit to carry a concealed weapon, one needs a permit to carry a concealed weapon. If one lacks that permit, one is in violation of the law. Steffon Josey-Davis was in violation of the law.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#related#And yet a couple of factors complicate the story somewhat. The first is that, at the time of his arrest, New Jersey was experimenting with a firearms amnesty that explicitly applied to the very provisions of which Josey-Davis was eventually found guilty. Evan Nappen, the prolific firearms attorney who has now taken charge of Josey-Davis's appeal, holds that his client should never have been detained in the first place. \"He shouldn't be in this situation,\" Nappen says over the phone. \"The amnesty was in force.\"\n\nNappen has a point. Not only is the plain language of the law on his side, but he has a solid legal precedent to point to as well. In State of New Jersey v. Onn Rapeika, decided in January of this year, Judge James J. Guida dismissed a series of firearms-related indictments that had been leveled against a drug dealer because an \"amnesty program (P.L. 2013, c.117) passed by the Legislature . . . was in effect at the time\" when the police found his guns. \"Armed with statutory construction and the synopsis that the law provides a 'window' to dispose of certain unlawfully possessed firearms,\" Guida wrote, \"the only logical conclusion to be reached is that defendant cannot be prosecuted for possession.\" \"The plain reading of the statute,\" he added, \"indicates defendant had until February 4, 2014 to exercise one of the disposal options authorized.\" And yet the \"firearms were seized on January 3, 2014,\" a month before the deadline.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat amnesty program went into effect on August 8, 2013. Steffon Josey-Davis was stopped on September 20. The obvious question, then: If Onn Rapeika is covered by its protections, why is Josey-Davis not?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, if the appeals court agrees with Nappen's logic, Josey-Davis may well find himself freed by the perverse breadth of the very rules that were used to prosecute him. Unlike most states, New Jersey does not have a law on the books that explicitly prohibits carrying a firearm without a permit; instead, the state requires anybody who is discovered in possession of a firearm to demonstrate either that he has a concealed-carry permit or that he is exempt from prosecution under one of the few legal exemptions that the state has reluctantly carved out in Title 2c:39\u20136 of its Code of Criminal Justice. Or, put another way, rather than presuming that its citizens may do anything with their firearms that has not been explicitly prohibited, New Jersey presumes that all gun owners are guilty of illegal possession unless they \u2014 or their temporary behaviors \u2014 are exempted from the law. The practical upshot of this is that if a gun owner cannot prove that he is exempt from prosecution, he is deemed by default to be in illegal possession \u2014 regardless of whether he has purchased his firearms legally (which Josey-Davis did), or whether he intended to commit a crime (which Josey-Davis did not).\n\nThis being so, Nappen's amnesty claim makes a great deal of sense.

His slipping out of Moscow and crossing the world would have been seen as a remarkable act of defiance against the power of the American government. Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro had offered him asylum after visiting Russia for the Gas Exporting Countries Forum, at the beginning of July. He declared that Snowden had done nothing wrong and was being subjected to a \"crazy manhunt\" by the United States authorities, and promised to protect him once he arrived in Caracas. It is probably no accident that Maduro made the announcement on July 5th, Venezuela's independence day.\n\nDomestic critics argued that Maduro should have given priority to repairing the country's relationship with the United States, damaged after long years of quarreling under his predecessor, the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, particularly after both countries withdrew their ambassadors in 2010. Others speculated that a hero's welcome for Snowden would give a much-needed boost to Maduro's popularity. It was also suggested that Snowden would be exchanged for Luis Posada Carriles, a terrorist of Cuban extraction now living in Miami, who Venezuela has been seeking to extradite for blowing up a Cubana Airlines plane in 1976, killing seventy-three people. Or that the Cubans would get their hands on him, and then exchange him for the remaining four members of the Cuban Five\u2014agents convicted in Florida for espionage. Laureano M\u00e1rquez, a prominent comedian and opposition columnist, wrote that Maduro had expelled the filmmaker Tim Tracy, accusing him without evidence of being a spy for the C.I.A., in order to bring in Snowden, a full-time, real spy.\n\nThe impact Snowden's presence might have on the relationship between the United States and Venezuela was a constant topic of discussion for both Chavistas and the opposition. Speculation about possible U.S. retaliations ran from cancelling the visas of high-level officials to stopping purchases of Venezuelan oil.\n\nThere's no doubt that Snowden would have been a valuable asset for the Venezuelan government, which is seeking to legitimize itself after elections in April were questioned by the opposition, and which has lost much of the glow and potency Ch\u00e1vez conferred to it. But after keeping Venezuela waiting for a formal reply, Snowden, who has now been languishing for a month in Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport, made the surprise announcement that he will stay in the land of Pussy Riot\u2014and Putin\u2014until the conditions for his journey are more favorable.\n\nAt that, the Snowden case disappeared almost instantaneously from Venezuelan media, enveloped in the most rotund official silence. Several government officials asked for comment said that the only people authorized to speak about the case were the Minister for Foreign Affairs, El\u00edas Jaua, and Maduro himself.\n\nLast Thursday, the newspaper ABC de Espa\u00f1a disclosed that Secretary of State John Kerry had called Jaua on Friday, July 12th, to talk about the Venezuelan offer. The newspaper described Kerry's tone as intimidating, and said that the Secretary of State had threatened Jaua with bold actions against Venezuela if the asylum materialized. Among other things, these steps would include stopping the sale of gasoline and other oil derivatives from Venezuela and suspending U.S. visas for diplomats, officials, and businessmen. On Friday, an unnamed State Department source told the D.P.A. news agency that, indeed, there had been a call, but that it was \"completely untrue\" that Kerry had bullied Jaua or given details about possible sanctions. The Venezuelan government's silence was regarded as an implicit acknowledgement that the issue is too delicate to risk any miscalculation that might worsen the impasse.\n\nThe fragile truce was broken when Obama's nominee for United Nations ambassador, Samantha Power, promised before a Senate committee last Wednesday that she would stand up against \"repressive regimes\" and \"the crackdown on civil society being carried out in countries like Cuba, Iran, Russia, and Venezuela.\"\n\nThe remarks infuriated Maduro, who, in a full bravado, responded, \"As president, my policy is zero tolerance for any attacks the Gringos make on Venezuela. I'm not going to tolerate any sort of aggression against Venezuela\u2014verbal, political, or diplomatic. That's enough! You there with your empire. No more meddling with Venezuela.\" Venezuela, he said, was suspending ongoing talks to improve relations with the U.S. He also reaffirmed his willingness to give asylum to Snowden, since \"the right to asylum is an international humanitarian right, and Venezuela has always respected it.\"\n\nMaduro, that is to say, found it more convenient to step back to the previous status quo than to move forward and regularize the relations. By doing so, he can claim that he cares enough about the nationalistic values"}

The contributors to this tutorial include Jason Alderman Taeyoon Choi and Luisa Pereira\n\nThis is a field guide for debugging for everyone\u2014whether you are beginning to code or whether you have been coding for a long time, this guide breaks down the mysterious process of solving problems.\n\n0. Debugging is a Creative Act\n\nAt all levels, programmers encounter bugs and will often spend more time debugging than actually programming the application. You can expect to spend a lot of time doing this and so it is important to develop good strategies for identifying and working through bugs as you learn to program in p5.js. A bug is a gap between what you think your system is doing, and what it is actually doing. Clay Shirky aptly describes a bug as \"the moment when there is both a technical problem with your code as well as a problem with your mental picture of what is happening in your code.\" You think you are telling the computer one thing, but it is doing something else. It may also be crashing or throwing errors. In order to close the gap, you must investigate. When you are working on a project, you may play many different roles. You are an architect when designing and planning your program, an engineer when you are developing it. Then you will be an explorer, discovering the problems and errors and testing it in all the situations in which it needs to run. You are trying to find out where it might break. Finally, when debugging you are a detective, trying to figure out how and why things broke. So how can you become a good detective and debug your program? Here are the ten steps that can help you become a good code sleuth.\n\n1. Change Perspectives.\n\nDon't panic. When you encounter a bug that you do not know how to solve, stop, pause and take a deep breath. Stand up, say hi to the dog, take a walk or if it's late go get some sleep. When you are frustrated, tired and upset, you are not in a good frame of mind to learn or solve a problem. To find your errors you will need to change perspectives and become the detective. The goal is to find out what the program IS doing, rather than why it's not doing what it's supposed to. We need to get the computer to show us what it's doing. The clues are in the values of variables and flow of program.\n\n2. Observe the problem\n\nWalk someone through the issue even if they themselves do not know how to program. If no one is around, draft an email explaining what you have done and breaking down what the problem is. You probably won't need to actually send this email as often the act of writing it will help you to locate and identify what you need to do next. Some programmers have even been known to explain their problem to a friendly inanimate object like a rubber ducky. This is also a good time to add comments to your code that tell you exactly what each of your functions is doing. Some coders also print out their code (or a section of it) and go through it line by line, tracing the path of variables and making notes.\n\n3. Before you start...\n\nBefore doing anything, save a copy of your code that you can go back to. While debugging you are likely to introduce other problems, break things or accidentally delete good work. You don't want to make bigger bugs in the process of debugging. If you make a mistake or your problem gets more worse, you can always UNDO or revert back to your saved file. You can try version control such as GitHub. Write a list of what you are trying, so you can keep track of what still needs to be checked. Be methodical, it will save you a lot of time in the long run. Only ever change one thing at a time. As you debug, you will be turning parts of your code on and off. Every time you make a change, test your program. If you make multiple changes before testing, you will not know which change has what effect and are likely to break things further.\n\n4. Check the basics\n\nMany bugs end up being very basic mistakes, equivalent to forgetting to plug in the power cord. These mistakes are so obvious they are often invisible. Check the dumb stuff like... Are you editing the file that you are actually running (and not, for example, editing the local file, and looking at a different file on the server)?\n\nAre all of your external files where you think they are?\n\nAre your file dependencies correct?\n\nAre there any typos in your paths?\n\nCheck your server? etc.\n\n5.

Former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko was trailing far behind, with about 13%.\n\nUkrainians flocked to the polling stations on Sunday in what was seen as the most important election since independence. Millions of citizens in the restive east, however, did not vote at all, either because of separatist sympathies, feelings of intimidation by pro-Russian militias or simply a lack of polling stations.\n\n\"Today we can definitely say all of Ukraine has voted, this is a national vote,\" said Poroshenko from his campaign headquarters shortly after the exit polls were released. \"The first steps that we will take at beginning of presidential office should be focused on stopping the war, to put an end to this chaos and bring peace to a united Ukraine.\" Poroshenko promised to hold parliamentary elections before the end of the year. \"When there is a parliamentarian crisis, the only solution in a democracy is early elections,\" he said.\n\nHe also committed himself to start a dialogue with Russia and launch negotiations for a new treaty to replace the Budapest memorandum \u2013 the 1994 document in which Russia, the US and the UK promised to protect Ukrainian territorial integrity in exchange for the country giving up its nuclear arms. His first trip as president, he said, would be to the Donbass region.\n\nEarlier in the day, voters said they felt the election was an important step toward solving the country's political crisis, and several said they wanted Poroshenko to exceed the 50% threshold to avoid a runoff vote in three weeks.\n\n\"Since Russia doesn't recognise our government, it's very important that the people say that now there is one person they support. Then the whole world will understand that their position is absurd,\" said Vladimir Pestenkov, an executive at an IT company.\n\nBut truck driver Alexander Pivin was one of a significant minority sceptical about Poroshenko. He voted for a controversial radical, Oleh Lyashko, the only candidate who went to the restive regions in the east, where he took part in operations against separatists.\n\n\"I don't like that they're forcing Poroshenko on us as the unity candidate,\" Pivin said. \"At this moment, when people are dying in the east, politicians shouldn't be here [Kiev] or in the west where it's peaceful, they should be at the hotspots.\"\n\nLyashko came third, with 8% of the vote, according to exit polls. Turnout was reported to be high in most of the country.\n\n\"The turnout is a lot higher this time, which is good, although the election workers are barely able to keep up,\" said Olesya Maximenko, a vote observer with the civil society non-governmental organisation OPORA in Kiev, said turnout was high. \"These elections cost us lives and blood so, knowing the price, the least people could do is come out and vote.\"\n\nIn the east, polling day revealed how much work the government in Kiev has in store to bring the region back under control. It was always expected that in separatist strongholds such as Slavyansk there would be no voting but, more surprisingly, in Donetsk, a city of close to 1m people, not a single polling station opened. Even in the morning, sources inside the pro-Kiev administration said they hoped to have a number of polling stations open by the afternoon, but that did not happen.\n\nIn Dokuchayevsk, several of the 13 polling stations had planned to open but in the end none did. At School Number Three, there were plans for a late opening at 10am after the local committee finally received ballot papers overnight but, just before voting opened, a separatist representative arrived and demanded that the station was closed.\n\n\"He asked politely, but made it clear that if we did not accede, he would come back,\" said one of the election officials. The separatist made off with the ballot papers, and the town's only remaining polling station closed.\n\nThe closest town to normality in the region was Mariupol, scene of violence on 9 May when pro-Ukrainian forces entered the town and clashes broke out in which unarmed people were shot. Here, most polling stations opened.\n\nAfter oligarch Rinat Akhmetov, Ukraine's richest man and an important political broker, came out in the past fortnight against the separatist movement, he also ordered his factories to provide unarmed worker patrols to ensure order in the city. The separatist barricades have been removed, and workers were standing guard at polling stations. Voting proceeded smoothly but the atmosphere was tense.\n\n\"The ballots were delivered in the dead of night, and we weren't told they were coming until the last minute,\" said Sergei Pashkovsky, the head of"}

We get studies that say they work, and studies that say they are practically useless.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut now, at least temporarily, the debate over whether seasonal flu vaccines offer protection against the novel H1N1 virus , or increase your odds of catching it , takes center stage.\nIn the past couple of weeks we've heard a good deal about ` The Canadian Problem' , an as yet unpublished study that links getting last year's seasonal flu vaccine with an increased likelihood of catching the novel H1N1 virus.\nThis study is still undergoing peer review, but its impact has already been felt across much of Canada.\u00a0\u00a0 Many provinces have curtailed their seasonal flu vaccination programs for those under the age of 65, out of concern that taking the seasonal vaccine may exacerbate the pandemic.\nThe WHO and the CDC meanwhile say they've seen no evidence to support this supposed link. They continue to recommend taking the seasonal flu vaccine.\nAs if this weren't confusing enough, now we get a study published in the BMJ ( British Medical Journal) that suggests exactly the opposite - that getting the seasonal flu vaccination may be slightly protective against the swine flu.\nThis also runs contrary to what we've heard from the CDC , which\u00a0 maintains that the seasonal vaccine is not expected to offer any protection against the novel H1N1 swine flu virus.\nPublished 6 October 2009, doi:10.1136/bmj.b3928\nDesign Frequency matched case-control study.\nSetting Specialty hospital in Mexico City, March to May 2009.\nParticipants 60 patients with laboratory confirmed influenza A/H1N1 and 180 controls with other diseases (not influenza-like illness or pneumonia) living in Mexico City or the State of Mexico and matched for age and socioeconomic status.\nMain outcome measures Odds ratio and effectiveness of trivalent inactivated vaccine against influenza A/H1N1.\nResults Cases were more likely than controls to be admitted to hospital, undergo invasive mechanical ventilation, and die. Controls were more likely than cases to have chronic conditions that conferred a higher risk of influenza related complications. In the multivariate model, influenza A/H1N1 was independently associated with trivalent inactivated vaccine (odds ratio 0.27, 95% confidence interval 0.11 to 0.66) and underlying conditions (0.15, 0.08 to 0.30). Vaccine effectiveness was 73% (95% confidence interval 34% to 89%). None of the eight vaccinated cases died.\nConclusions Preliminary evidence suggests some protection from the 2008-9 trivalent inactivated vaccine against pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 , particularly severe forms of the disease, diagnosed in a specialty hospital during the influenza epidemic in Mexico City.\nSo, the reader is now in the unenviable position of having to decide decide between 3 different stances.\u00a0\n\u00a0 Taking the Seasonal Flu vaccine may increase your odds of getting the pandemic flu (Canadian Unpublished Study) Taking the Seasonal Flu vaccine may decrease your odds of getting the pandemic flu (BMJ study) Taking the seasonal flu vaccine has no effect on your risks of acquiring the pandemic flu (CDC)\nThese are not trivial matters.\u00a0\u00a0 Lives, and global public health policies, hinge on sorting this all out as quickly ( and scientifically accurately ) as possible. This kind of ambiguity and debate, while fascinating to us disease-geeks-types, no doubt breeds apathy and mistrust among the public.\nThis BMJ study is, admittedly, on a very small number of patients.\u00a0 The Canadian study is unpublished, and so we have very little to go on.\u00a0\u00a0 So, as always, Caveat Lector.\nAs far as which study is right, I've no idea.\nSince I've already gotten my seasonal shot, I'm hoping it's either option #2 or #3.\u00a0\nBut I suppose only time will tell."}

In this part we're looking at generic types.\n\nInheritance and subtyping are a powerful tool for abstracting over types. But this tool has its limitations. It can't help us express generic container types like collections. For this problem we need parameterized types. We've seen plenty of parameterized types already\u2014for example, iterables, sequences, and tuples\u2014but now let's explore a few more details.\n\nGeneric types\n\nProgramming with generic types is one of the most difficult parts of Java. That's still true, to some extent, in Ceylon. But because the Ceylon language and SDK were designed for generics from the ground up, Ceylon is able to alleviate the most painful aspects of Java's bolted-on-later model.\n\nThere are two kinds of things which may be generic:\n\na class, interface, or type alias, or\n\na function.\n\nType parameters\n\nJust like in Java, only types and methods may declare type parameters. Also just like in Java, type parameters are listed before ordinary parameters, enclosed in angle brackets.\n\nshared interface Iterator<out Element> { ... }\n\nshared class Singleton<out Element>(Element element) extends Object() satisfies [Element+] given Element satisfies Object { ... }\n\nshared Value sum<Value>({Value+} values) given Value satisfies Summable<Value> { ... }\n\nshared <Key->Item>[] zip<Key,Item>({Key*} keys, {Item*} items) given Key satisfies Object given Item satisfies Object { ... }\n\nAs you can see, the convention in Ceylon is to use meaningful names for type parameters (in other languages the usual convention is to use single letter names).\n\nType arguments\n\nUnlike Java, we always do need to specify type arguments in a type declaration (there are no raw types in Ceylon). The following will not compile:\n\nvalue strings = {\"hello\", \"world\"}; Iterator it = strings.iterator(); //error: missing type argument to parameter Element of Iterable\n\nInstead, we have to provide a type argument like this:\n\nvalue strings = {\"hello\", \"world\"}; Iterator<String> it = strings.iterator();\n\nOn the other hand, it would be very annoying if we always had to specify all type arguments explicitly everywhere.\n\nType argument inference\n\nFortunately, we don't need to explicitly specify type arguments in most method invocations or class instantiations. We don't usually need to write:\n\nArray<String> strings = Array<String> { \"Hello\", \"World\" }; {String|Integer*} things = interleave<String|Integer,Null>(strings, 0..2);\n\nInstead, it's very often possible to infer the type arguments from the ordinary arguments.\n\nvalue strings = Array { \"Hello\", \"World\" }; // type Array<String> value things = interleave(strings, 0..2); // type {String|Integer*}\n\nThe generic type argument inference algorithm is slightly involved, so you should refer to the language specification for a complete definition. But essentially what happens is that Ceylon infers a type argument by combining the types of corresponding arguments using union in the case of a covariant type parameter, or intersection in the case of a contravariant type parameter.\n\nvalue points = Array { Polar(pi/4, 0.5), Cartesian(-1.0, 2.5) }; // type Array<Polar|Cartesian> value entries = zipEntries(1..points.size, points); // type {<Integer->Polar|Cartesian>*}\n\nThere's one more way to avoid having to write in type arguments explicitly.\n\nDefault type arguments\n\nA type parameter may have a default argument.\n\nshared interface Iterable<out Element, out Absent=Null> ...\n\nIf a type parameter has a default argument, we're allowed to leave out the type argument to that type parameter when we supply a type argument list. Therefore:\n\nIterable<String> means Iterable<String,Null> , and\n\nmeans , and Iterable<> means Iterable<Anything,Null> .\n\nNote that we needed to explicitly specify the pointy brackets in Iterable<> .\n\nGotcha!\n\nDefault type arguments are always ignored when type arguments are inferred.\n\nSuppose I have a generic class with a default argument:\n\nclass Container<out Element=Anything>(Element* elements) {}\n\nLet's instantiate this class without any arguments:\n\nvalue container = Container();\n\nYou might imagine that this instantiation would produce a Container"}

In the case of Strieff, he was illegally detained during a \"concededly unconstitutional detention,\" which eventually led to the discovery of drugs inside his vehicle.\n\nIn Strieff's case, a trial court judge later found that the officer did not have enough evidence to initially stop and question him. But the judge ruled that Strieff's subsequent arrest on an outstanding traffic warrant justified the search \u2014 implying that the use of criminal behavior to catch criminal behavior is just.\n\nThe Utah Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court that the drug evidence was admissible at trial, but, in a moment of logic, the Utah Supreme Court last year reversed that decision.\n\nThe Utah Supreme Court noted in its January 2015 decision that the case presented \"a gap of substantial significance\" in terms of prior rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court on Fourth Amendment issues, and that other courts that have addressed the issue have come to \"substantially different conclusions\" regarding search and seizure law.\n\n\nThe Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule allows criminal defendants to suppress \"fruit of the poisonous tree\" \u2014 that is, evidence obtained as a result of a search or seizure that violates the Fourth Amendment. The reason this rule exists is due to the obvious conflict of interests in cops breaking the law to enforce the law.\n\nHowever, thanks to Monday's ruling by the Supreme Court, that is exactly what will happen now. Police have essentially been given a free pass to violate the rights of individuals \u2014 just so long as they find evidence of a 'crime.'\n\nOn Monday, the logic applied by the Utah Supreme Court in 2015, was thrown to the wayside in a handout to the police state.\n\nGiven the reality of the militarized police state rising up from the horrors of the war on drugs, the fact that cops can now legally act illegally to bust people for possessing arbitrary substances is chilling.\n\nAs if breaking the law wasn't enough, prior to this ruling, police were no longer required to even give the appearance of an understanding of the laws they're tasked with enforcing, thanks to a recent court decision surpassing even the veritable green light previously granted in Heien v. North Carolina.\n\nIn the Heien case, the Supreme Court ruled a \"police officer's reasonable mistake of law gives rise to reasonable suspicion that justifies a traffic stop under the Fourth Amendment.\" A motorist's broken tail light caused an officer to make a traffic stop \u2014 during which evidence of a separate violation of the law was discovered in the vehicle.\n\nBut in North Carolina, a broken tail light wasn't illegal, thus not sufficient cause to justify the stop \u2014 nor the arrests stemming from it, lawyers argued, because that would be a violation of unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court ruled the officer's ignorance of the law essentially didn't matter \u2014 effectively allowing police around the country the ability to make stops if they 'reasonably' believe the cause for the stop is legal. Plainly, police can stop and search you despite ignorance of the law.\n\nNow, in U.S. v Shelton Barnes et. al. \u2014 a case that seemed to slip by largely unnoticed \u2014 even that flimsy justification has been deemed too constricting of police power, and police ignorance can actually be used against you in a trial.\n\nOn Monday, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said in dissent that the decision in Utah vs. Edward Joseph Strieff, is a blow to constitutional rights.\n\n\"The court today holds that the discovery of a warrant for an unpaid parking ticket will forgive a police officer's violation of your Fourth Amendment rights,\" Sotomayor wrote.\n\nSotomayor's dissent was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Elena Kagan.\n\nNow, police need not understand the law, or even abide by the law \u2014 to enforce the law.

But opponents warn the policy could have dangerous consequences.\n\nThe bill \"will have real and potentially devastating consequences for people across our state,\" Jamiel Shaw Sr., whose 17-year-old son was killed, said in a statement.\n\nShaw separately put out a web video appealing to Brown to reject the bill.\n\nMore On This... Governor Brown, please veto immigration bill AB 1081\n\n\"Would you want that to happen to your son? ... How many have to die by people being let out into the streets from the county jail that should be deported,\" he said in the video. \"No one should have to go through losing a child.\"\n\nClick for the original story on Shaw's case.\n\nShaw's son Jamiel Shaw Jr., a high school football player, was killed in 2008 by a member of the 18th Street Gang hours after he had been released from a local jail. Pedro Espinoza was found guilty of the murder, in which he shot Shaw twice after mistaking him for a rival gang member. A jury recommended the death penalty for Espinoza earlier this year.\n\nBob Dane, a spokesman at the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said California would open the door to a rampant public safety threat -- as well as additional financial burden on the state -- if the governor lets the bill become law. He noted Brown could opt to take no action on the bill, allowing it to become law by default.\n\n\"It's the perfect storm for complete lawlessness,\" he told FoxNews.com, saying the state would be rolling out \"the welcome mat\" for illegal immigrants and become even more of a magnet.\n\n\"This is not the work of responsible custodians of the public trust,\" he said.\n\nThe bill would compel law enforcement in California to release illegal immigrants once they become eligible -- even if ICE wants them held -- unless the individual has been convicted of a \"serious or violent felony.\"\n\nSupporters cited the financial burden on local communities that hold these detainees for ICE and the potential erosion of trust with police.\n\nIn a Sept. 13 letter to Brown signed by House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic members of the California congressional delegation, supporters urged the governor to sign the bill. They cited accounts that a federal program called Secure Communities \"currently erodes trust between local communities and law enforcement.\"\n\n\"They report that the initiative already has reduced the willingness of immigrant and non-immigrant crime victims and witnesses to cooperate with law enforcement and has consequently diminished public safety,\" they wrote. The suggestion is that illegal immigrants would be reluctant to report crimes out of concern ICE would come after them.\n\nSecure Communities is a program that allows federal immigration agents to work with local officials to determine who in local jails might be deportable.\n\nBut Shaw argues that police in California are not interested in checking the immigration status of people who report or witness crimes.\n\nFurther, he argues that in California in particular, illegal immigrants are not fearful of law enforcement.\n\nFederal immigration officials have defended the Secure Communities program, which they say has helped the agency remove nearly 150,000 convicted criminals to date -- including murderers and rapists.\n\nICE Director John Morton wrote in an Aug. 23 letter to FAIR that communities that ignore ICE requests to hold detainees \"are undermining public safety in their communities by exposing their local communities to risks from suspected and convicted sex offenders, weapons violators, drunk drivers and other violent criminals.\"\n\n\"These are not hypothetical risks,\" he wrote. The letter was in reference to a separate initiative in Illinois.\n\nICE spokeswoman Gillian Christensen told FoxNews.com on Wednesday that the agency implements \"clear priorities\" to focus on convicted criminals. She stressed the importance of local cooperation, without commenting specifically on the California proposal.\n\n\"The federal government alone sets these priorities and places detainers on individuals arrested on criminal charges to ensure that dangerous criminal aliens and other priority individuals are not released from prisons/jails and into our communities,\" she said. \"The Administration remains committed to immigration reform and to enforcing current law in a smart and effective manner across the country.\""}

{"id": 259728, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Most of us scratch our heads when we hear about an incidence of someone being found innocent, despite being convicted of a crime by a jury. We think, \"How could the jury have gotten it so wrong?\"\n\nBut we really sit up and notice when not only an innocent person is sent to prison, not just on an eyewitness's testimony or such, but on the convicted person's own confession! What could lead an innocent person to confess to a crime they did not commit?\n\nSadly, this happens far more often than you might realize. Somewhere between 20 to 25% of all DNA exonerations involve innocent people who confessed to the crime. DNA exonerations are where a crime's evidence is re-evaluated and tested using modern DNA discovery procedures not available at the time the crime was committed that prove the crime could not have been committed by the person serving time for the crime in prison.\n\nA new article by Saul Kassin (2008) looks at some of the reasons innocent people confess. He describes three primary types of false confessions:\n\nVoluntary \u2014 The person confesses to a crime they did not commit without prompting from the police.\n\nCompliant \u2014 The person confesses to a crime through inducement or the process of the police interrogation.\n\nInternalized \u2014 The person confesses to a crime because they are high vulnerable and are exposed to suggestive interrogation tactics where they come to believe they actually committed the crime.\n\nSo what factors put innocent suspects at risk to confess? Kassin identifies three:\n\n1. Situational risk factors\n\nCertain police interrogation tactics commonly employed may exert too strong an influence over a person's willingness to falsely confess. For instance, the presentation of false evidence or misinformation by the police can increase a person's willingness to confess. Studies have shown that the introduction of false evidence (\"We know you did it because we have an eyewitness that puts you at the scene of the crime\") could raise one's willingness to sign a confession from 48 to 94%. Some people even start to believe they committed the crime!\n\nPolice interrogators are also very good at minimizing the crime, to help a person feel more comfortable and willing to confess to it. They may offer sympathy or moral justification for committing the crime, helping a person feel more free and at ease to confess. Such tactics work to gain confessions from the guilty, but also increase false confessions from the innocent.\n\n2. Dispositional vulnerabilities\n\nKassin suggests that some people are \"dispositionally more malleable than others,\" meaning that their personalities are more prone to compliance and agreement, so as to avoid confrontation, stress or displeasing others. Some people are also more suggestible than others, meaning that during an interrogation police can lead the person into a false set of beliefs that the person will end up agreeing with. \"People who are highly anxious, fearful, depressed, delusional, or otherwise psychologically disordered, and people who are mentally retarded, are particularly prone to confess under pressure,\" noted Kassin.\n\nHe also singled out youth and young people at being higher risk, because they more often than not waive their right to remain quiet and not be interrogated by police (even with a parent present, because the parent often wrongly encourages the youth to cooperate with the police and answer their questions). Youth and teenagers often engage in behavior that is focused on short-term, immediate gratification and impulsivity, without taking into account future repercussions or consequences. Confessing to police in such situations may provide a teen a quick way out of a stressful situation (while causing them to confess to a crime they did not commit).\n\n3. The phenomenology of innocence\n\nPeople who are truly innocent of committing any crime naively believe that the justice system will ferret out the truth in a fair trial, ensuring a \"not guilty\" verdict (ala an episode of \"Law and Order\"). Sadly, this is rarely the case. The people say, \"I did nothing wrong,\" or, \"I have nothing to hide.\" Be that as it may, the justice system isn't setup to protect the innocent nearly as much as it is to try cases and process people through the system as quickly as possible. If you know you're innocent, your safest bet is to remain silent and do not talk to the police.\n\nNeed more proof? Watch this YouTube video from Prof. James Duane, a law professor at Regent Law School and a former defense attorney for all the reasons you should never talk to the police \u2014 especially if you are innocent. (And if you don't believe him, watch the Part 2 of the video where VA Beach Police Officer George Bruch reiterates the same advice.) For instance, one of the nefarious ways discussed in the video that police get an innocent person to confess is to write an \"apology letter\" to the crime victim. This letter is then used as the written and signed confession at trial. And it always works.\n\nBecause once a jury hears your confession, your chances at trial decrease significantly ("}

The authorities seem to be saying, yes. But, because of her close ties to the fraudulent Obama Birth Certificate, many people fear that she was the most recent in Obama's \"dead pool\" and haven't stopped looking for real answers. It seems that amateur bloggers and Youtubers are the new Investigative Journalists in this new media society of \"give the President a pass, or be a racist\".\n\nI recently came across a video and still photos that were meticulously retrieved by a fellow blogger, from the Ferdinand Puentes GoCam videos that he took of the plane crash on December 11, 2013 in which Loretta Fuddy died. The photos can be found here: http://butterdezillion.wordpress.com/2014/02/13/extras/ . She has more shots there than I am showing, so check it out. Many thanks \u2013 great work!\n\nThe Puentes video originally aired on ABC in January 2014 and can be seen here. http://abcnews.go.com/US/harrowing-video-hawaiian-plane-crash-inside-cabin/story?id=21484715 The segment depicted below is at about 3:33 minutes in the video and lasts about 3 seconds. There has been a lot of speculation about this \"accident\", as so many things just don't add up. The story of a tragic death was reported before rescuers had even gotten to the plane. First reports indicated someone remained in the plane, when in fact, all got out. And the only death was the one person who really might know the truth about Obama's birth certificate. It took a month for vague autopsy results. The local police and the NTSB couldn't decide who was in charge of the investigation into her death.\n\nDr. Fuddys death was declared to be from a problem with her heart \u2013 natural causes, and we're all supposed to believe that it was all just a tragic accident, but after seeing these photos, all doubt is gone. As I looked through the still shots taken from the video, my blood froze, because I knew what I was seeing. I am seeing a diver do something to Loretta Fuddy, which I assume was murder, and it chills me to the bone. I hope that law enforcement can be made aware of what seems to be shown in these pictures, so they can investigate it. Just look, please. Form your own opinion.\n\nThe first photos are reference photos of what I think you'll be able to see in the actual photos. (they are NOT actual photos of the divers in the video- the shoe is really Dr. Fuddy's)\n\nTHE PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE\n\nThe photos below are in sequence. The ones on the left are the originals \u2013 to the right I have highlighted what I see. Beyond frightening. This whole video sequence takes about 3 seconds in real time.The series of photos shown below are the actual stills of the events that are shown on Ferdinand Puentes video. http://abcnews.go.com/US/harrowing-video-hawaiian-plane-crash-inside-cabin/story?id=21484715 These photos have been zoomed and cropped by Butterdezillion. In the GoPro video, the action is actually quite a distance away. You can click on any set to enlarge them to see better.\n\nStart with Picture #1, and follow the sequence like a movie. I have labeled people and things on the right hand picture. This is Loretta Fuddy on the right and Keith Yamamoto on the left. He is looking at her. She is laying back into her flotation device. Her head is just visible and one shoe is visible. The shoe is important \u2013 and remember, all of this takes 3 seconds in real time.\n\nSo, there you have it. Loretta Fuddy is floating in her life jacket holding hands with her Assistant, Keith Yamamoto. A diver completely dressed in black surfaces momentarily for about 3 seconds and seems to be doing something to her foot or leg. My theory is that he administered some type of injection that ultimately caused Dr. Fuddy's death. The he lets go and vanishes. The plan was not to be seen, but she may have felt something and pulled her foot away, and he had no choice but to surface to get to the foot. I have no idea why that would be so important, unless they felt that a medical examiner is less likely to see an injection site on a foot or ankle.\n\nOthers seem to think that what I see as a foot is a second diver, because Loretta Fuddy was wearing \"Black shoes\".

For this rare treasure we must thank the Park Circus film organisation, whose estimable quest is to \"put great pictures back on the big screen\".\n\nNow in their 12th year, Park Circus organises screenings of films from across the spectrum of cinema history \u2014 from mainstream to margins \u2014 and in this DVD age Welles' movie is fully deserving of a proper projected showing.\n\nPlacing The Lady from Shanghai in any one category is tricky. As an example of the film-noir style it pointedly reflects upon America's post-war pessimism about its decaying ideals. Simultaneously, the picture recalls the earlier style and symbolism of German Expressionism, which Welles had masterfully exhibited in Citizen Kane (1940) \u2014 acute camera angles, exaggerated close-ups, sharp-edged light and shade.\n\nThe combined effect implies that as society's morality becomes undermined, its mentality gets unhinged. And while Welles displays the quirky qualities he admired in European cinema \u2014 overlapping dialogue, improvised action \u2014 he also sticks to the solid plot structure of classical Hollywood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed the plot of The Lady from Shanghai is almost text-book noir \u2014 some dumb schmuck who reckons he's known every peril is smitten by a woman who gives him more peril than he knows.\n\nWhen seasoned seaman Michael O'Hara (Welles himself) rescues the mysterious and luminous Elsa Bannister (Rita Hayworth, aka Mrs Welles) from a mugging in New York's Central Park, he doesn't foresee the spider's web that's about to entangle him.\n\nNoir enthusiasts will recognise this narrative set-up from, among others, Huston's Maltese Falcon (1941) and Wilder's Double Indemnity (1944). As that mordant but oft-quoted synopsis of film noir has it: \"A girl with a past meets a guy with no future.\"\n\nBut if the plot of the movie stays close to the shore of noir style, Welles' staging of the story sails far from the usual course. The Lady from Shanghai was adapted from a dime novel titled If I Die Before I Wake, penned by Sherwood King.\n\nThe O'Hara character was originally named Laurence Planter, who gets in over his head in elevated New York society. Welles changed the character's name and his back story, making him a picaresque hero with an enigmatic past, a wandering adventurer and veteran of the Spanish Civil War who's killed a Franco spy. It's this last episode in O'Hara's background that earns him the nickname Black Irish and leaves him with a troubled conscience.\n\nA major turning point comes when O'Hara is offered a job by the definitely lame, defiantly nasty but distinctly wealthy Arthur Bannister, played by Welles disciple Everett Sloane, who makes limping around on two walking-sticks seem somehow threatening.\n\nMr Bannister is well aware that Mrs Bannister holds a torch for O'Hara but nevertheless hires him to pilot their yacht (Welles borrowed one from Errol Flynn) from New York to San Francisco. By altering the narrative setting to a sea journey, Welles turned the story into a mini Odyssey, with O'Hara as a kind of Ulysses who finds he's swimming with sharks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movie even includes a siren's song, as Elsa purrs her way through a soft, sultry rendition of Please Don't Kiss Me. \"Some people can smell danger \u2014 not me,\" O'Hara mourns. He slowly realises that more than his job depends on him resisting the temptations of his employer's spurious spouse, as the plot turns to murder and to bluff and double bluff.\n\nThe cynicism of the Bannister couple was reflective of the Welles/Hayworth marriage, then disintegrating, and the tension crossed over to the screen. \"You know, I'm pretty tired of both of us,\" Bannister tells his wife. Welles wrote this line for the character, but he might have said the same thing himself.\n\nWelles considered 'Black Irish' as the movie's original title, a nod to his time spent in Ireland as a teenager. He once called Ireland \"a land haunted with the raw materials of tall tales\". In 2011 a TG4 documentary on Welles said he became \"an adventurer embarking on great"}

I was a street smart kid with a tougher skin than most, and I came out of my experience with Weinstein physically unscathed, but that doesn't make the story less shocking or emotionally jarring.\n\nAs a model I was used to predatory men and had become adept at brushing off unwanted advances and putting creepy perverts in their place. I had protected other, younger models from flashers and gropers, and had even scared away a knife wielding attacker on the Paris Metro by laughing in his face. He didn't know it was a nervous reaction and probably thought I was crazier than he. But, all in all, I was still a naive girl from New Zealand, and no matter how tough I thought I was, I was completely out of my depth and very trusting.\n\nI met Harvey Weinstein in Cannes at the Film Festival. We were seated next to each other at a fancy dinner. I didn't catch his name and assumed I was talking to another hungry producer trying to sell a little movie to the big wigs. Feeling sorry for him, I went out of my way to be entertaining and nice. It wasn't until later in the meal that I asked the name of his production company.\n\n\"Miramax.\"\n\nI laughed and told Harvey that we had a friend in common. Miramax had recently released the Oscar winning film 'The Piano' made by a family friend, Jane Campion. I told Harvey that Jane felt like a pseudo god-mother to me and related a story of how, when I was an angry teenager in a fight with my mom, she had given me a note that read\"If you ever need to run away\u2026\" and made me feel like I had an ally.\n\nWith a dear mutual friend in common I felt safe with Harvey. The night was young and so was I. After dinner our large group, which included my Italian modelling agent, a few rich douchebags, some decorative models, and Harvey's entourage, rolled out into the Cannes night. Black town cars and gleaming limos took us to various parties where we glittered and shone like everyone else.\n\nHarvey and his assistant , Ben Silverman, never left my side.\n\nIt was fun. The last time I'd been in the South of France was in 1990. I had watched helplessly as Helena Christensen vomited all over the bathroom at Jimmy's after doing too much blow with Michael Hutchence and Jacques Chirac, who was in between his various Presidencies of France. In 1990 I was 16. Now, at 23 I was pretty jaded. Celebrities and their antics were old news. I could hold my own.\n\nAround midnight we ended up at a beautiful outdoor event at a mansion somewhere in a residential part of Cannes. Everyone was there, and everyone was fabulous. I saw Bono across the room. He yelled \"Dolphin Girl!\" and waved. I explained to Harvey that this wasn't a nickname that had anything to do with the popular sex toy, but a name I earned after a particularly weird night in Sydney, and a 3am skinny dipping adventure that scared the crap out of U2's bodyguards.\n\nIn retrospect I was putting on a tempting show. I didn't intend to titillate Mr Weinstein - I had no intention of leading him on. I felt safe in his company to be myself, and at no time in the evening did I feel anything but platonic energy from him.\n\nShortly after midnight my crew made moves to leave. We were staying on a large yacht moored in the bay and required water taxis to get us back out to it. Harvey and Ben offered us their cars and herded us towards the exit. My group was ushered into one car and I was somehow separated from them and told to get into another car with Harvey and his two friends. Stupidly, I obliged. I was told we were all going to the same place.\n\nTo this day I do not know if my Italian agent was in on the ruse. My instincts tell me he was.\n\nWe started driving. The 5 minute drive to the waterfront was taking longer and I asked where we were headed.\n\n\"Change of plans! We're all meeting at the Du Cap for one more drink.\"\n\nIt's a 30 minute drive to the Du Cap and it was close to 1am when we got there. We headed upstairs to Harvey's room and opened another bottle of champagne while we waited for the gang to arrive.\n\nBut the gang never arrived.\n\nAfter a few minutes a couple of the guys made motions to leave temporarily to make calls. The energy shifted and I became very uncomfortable. I turned to Ben and asked him to please get in touch with my friends immediately and find out where they were. Ben said he would go downstairs and see if"}

But it's easy to imagine the impact on impressionable children who see such people celebrated in the media and given special privileges.\n\nNational Geographic magazine put a transgender child on the cover of its January 2017 issue, a feature that includes a section called \"Helping Families Talk About Gender\" and an article titled \"Rethinking Gender.\" The message: Some children will be never be happy or healthy unless they are allowed to express their \"perceived gender.\"\n\nGet David Kupelian's culture war blockbusters: \"The Marketing of Evil,\" \"How Evil Works\" and his latest, \"The Snapping of the American Mind\" at the WND Superstore. Also available in e-book and audiobook versions.\n\nOthers, however, are worried that these children are merely going through a phase and will later regret any drastic steps taken to permanently switch their gender.\n\nOne such critic is Walt Heyer, founder of Sex Change Regret, who has first-hand experience with the issue. He cross-dressed starting at age 4 and went through hormone therapy and sex-change surgery. After eight years of living as a woman, he regretted his decision and had a second surgery to return to his birth gender.\n\nHeyer is a frequent columnist for The Federalist. In a January article discussing the National Geographic gender issue, Heyer wrote that \"studies have shown that childhood gender dysphoria does not inevitably continue into adulthood.\"\n\n\"An overwhelming 77 to 94 percent of gender dysphoric children do not become adults with gender dysphoria,\" he said.\n\nHeyer blames the increase in the number of children who think they have \"gender dysphoria\" on magazines like National Geographic.\n\n\"A cover photo is visually exciting and can persuade young people that male and female gender models are not fixed, when they are. Photos like the one on the cover of National Geographic can encourage a child to question his or her gender and sex and act out accordingly,\" he wrote.\n\nA paper written by three prominent doctors confirms Heyer's theory. Dr. Paul Hruz of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, along with Dr. Lawrence Mayer and Dr. Paul McHugh, both of Johns Hopkins University, published a study showing that cases of children with \"gender dysphoria\" have risen significantly in recent years.\n\nThey cited statistics from the Gender Identity Development Service in the United Kingdom, which only treats patients under 18 years old. Referrals of children with \"gender dysphoria\" jumped from 94 in 2009/2010 to 1,986 in 2016/2017 \u2013 an increase of almost 2,000 percent. Referrals at a clinic in Toronto, Canada, jumped from around 20 per year in 2004 to almost 100 per year in 2011.\n\nThe three doctors see the rise in such controversial medical intervention as exacerbating young people's obsession with becoming the opposite gender, when if just left alone, most would naturally grow out of the feelings.\n\n\"The medical treatments provided for children with apparent symptoms of gender dysphoria, including affirmation of gender expression from the earliest evidence of cross-gender behaviors, may drive some children to persist in identifying as transgender when they might otherwise have, as they grow older, found their gender to be aligned with their sex,\" they said.\n\n\"Gender identity for children is elastic (that is, it can change over time) and plastic (that is, it can be shaped by forces like parental approval and social conditions). If the increasing use of gender-affirming care does cause children to persist with their identification as the opposite sex, then many children who would otherwise not need ongoing medical treatment would be exposed to hormonal and surgical interventions.\"\n\nEven though statistically most children outgrow transgender feelings as they get older if left alone, the heightened attention given to transsexuals has also led to more parents seeking treatment that solidifies the condition, experts warn.\n\nHowever, in some countries, it's not only media coverage and peer pressure that force parents to seek medical affirmation for their gender-questioning child. It's the law of the land.\n\nGet David Kupelian's culture war blockbusters: \"The Marketing of Evil,\" \"How Evil Works\" and his latest, \"The Snapping of the American Mind\" at the WND Superstore.

It thrust the topic of abortion into the discussion during the September election campaign.\n\nWendy Robbins, a longtime advocate for improving access to abortion services in New Brunswick, said there is a need for better health services in the province. (CBC) Brian Gallant's Liberals pledged to review the province's abortion rules, particularly the regulation that forced women to get two doctors to declare an abortion was medically necessary before it would be paid for in a public hospital.\n\nThat promise prompted Gallant to be the target of anti-abortion postcards in the final days of the campaign.\n\nGallant announced in November that the contentious regulation was being removed. Starting in January, abortions still must be performed in a hospital to be covered by medicare, but the so-called two-doctor rule has been lifted.\n\nHospitals in Bathurst and Moncton are currently the only facilities that perform abortions. It's unclear how many additional hospitals may provide the service.\n\nThat means a woman who wants to have the procedure may need to drive three or four hours, depending on where she lives in the province.\n\nWhen the Liberal government changed the province's abortion policy, the rationale for restricting it being done in hospitals was because it would be treated like any other surgery.\n\nHealth minister responds\n\nHealth Minister Victor Boudreau said the government intends to keep that rule in place.\n\n\"Our government recently identified and eliminated the barriers in order to respect our legal obligations under the Supreme Court of Canada rulings and the Canada Health Act regarding a woman's right to choose,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"As it stands, this procedure will be funded by medicare when done in a hospital like other insured services.

Soon after passage, politicians and the media said it had not caused the downsides that activists had predicted, ignoring that the law had not been fully implemented. But troubling reports soon emerged.\n\nJason DeParle wrote a number of pieces in the New York Times about rising homelessness among Milwaukee families denied welfare under the new law. Welfare rolls were down, but the nation had unusually low unemployment, and many leaving the rolls had become homeless. Now, a new report shows that the Clinton welfare law is performing exactly as opponents feared, as the nation's deep recession allows states to force families off aid and into destitution. It is an American tragedy, largely ignored because the victims are primarily low-income women and their children.\n\nAfter reading Robert Pear's April 11 story on how welfare reform is playing out in blue-state Rhode Island, I wondered whether it would echo through the rest of the media. After all, the media had given extraordinarily positive coverage of the \"success\" of the 1996 law eliminating the federal welfare entitlement, and recall many reporters in the late 1990's who expressed surprise when I told them I thought the bill would cause great harm to families.\n\nToday, a decade after implementation, the Clinton-Republican \"bipartisan\" welfare law is a failure. As unemployment has doubled since 2007 and the number of people receiving food stamps has skyrocketed by 40%, the welfare caseload has risen only 10% \u2014 a clear indication that the nation's poorest families are not receiving welfare grants due to the restrictive time limits imposed by the 1996 law.\n\nAsk yourself: if the federal government allowed states to put time limits on food stamps, would those numbers have gone up 40%? Or would we have even more kids on the streets begging for alms?\n\nPolitics over Policy\n\nFamilies are suffering unnecessarily today because Bill Clinton branded himself a \"New Democrat,\" vowed to \"end welfare as we know it\" as part of his 1992 campaign, and then found himself at the start of his 1996 re-election year with not having passed welfare reform.\n\nIn the paranoid world of presidential politics, Clinton's people actually believed that Republican Bob Dole could defeat him that November unless welfare reform was passed. So Clinton, along with every Democratic Senator up for election that year except the late Paul Wellstone, joined with Republicans in enacting a welfare bill that omitted many of the essential safeguards that progressives had insisted be part of any deal.\n\nSafeguards like avoiding lifetime time limits, which were completely unrealistic in light of the nation's boom and bust economy. Or allowing states to cut or even eliminate benefits as sanctions against families allegedly missing work requirements, regardless of surrounding circumstances.\n\nLiberal supporters pointed to the increased funding for job training, and argued that this was worth the trade-off. Others pointed to the current system not giving recipients sufficient incentive to work (as if the meager grants available prior to 1996 would lead many people to prefer welfare to employment).\n\nFew with experience working with low-income families felt the time limits were anything but a strategy for states to reduce their rolls. And that is precisely what happened.\n\nProgressives Proven Correct\n\nWelfare reform was said to be a tremendous success in the years following passage, because the economy had jobs for welfare recipients and the lifetime time limits had not kicked in. And thousands of articles and columns written about welfare reform succeeded and why its progressive critics were wrong.\n\nAnd progressives were not simply criticized for backing the wrong policy. Instead, opponents were identified McGovernite, \"big government knows best,\" pie-in-the-sky 1960's throwbacks whose views had brought the Democratic Party nothing but failure in national elections.\n\nBut as progressives warned back in 1996, welfare reform could not be measured only by the first few years, or only during economic good times.\n\nAs family homeless shelters are overfilled in city after city, as mothers are forced to return to abusive husbands to get money for their kids, and as child poverty has greatly increased since 1996, the law's failure is clear.\n\nA 35-year Head Start worker in Woonsocket, Rhode Island told Pear, \"For the first time, we are seeing significant numbers of families who report no income whatsoever, zero, because they have reached the time limit on cash assistance or have been sanctioned for not meeting work requirements.\"\n\nSince 1996, the proportion of children receiving welfare has declined by 50%, while fewer than half of economically eligible families participate in the program.\n\nAs progressives predicted, the primary impact of the welfare law has been to deny cash assistance to the nation's poorest families. This escalation of poverty among the nation's families is a key part of Bill Clinton's legacy, ignored as he troops through the third world on missions to help the downtrodden.\n\nThe problems of the poor have"}

Lonetree had also handed over the floor plans of US embassies in Moscow and Vienna. His sentence was reduced to 15 years when the secretary of the navy found that the effect of his actions \"was minimal\". He was released after serving nine.\n\nArmy Specialist Albert T Sombolay\n\nIn 1991, Sombolay was convicted in a military court of giving a Jordanian intelligence agent information on the build-up for the first Iraq war.

He was sentenced to 34 years in jail, of which he served only 12.\n\nMichael Peri\n\nPeri, a military electronic warfare systems analyst for the US Army, was convicted of espionage in 1989. He was found to have stolen a portable computer used to store classified military information and handed it to East Germany. Peri pleaded guilty to espionage charges and was sentenced to 30 years in prison \u2013 avoiding a life sentence.\n\nThe Haditha killings\n\nUS marine Frank Wuterich with his lawyers. Photograph: Gregory Bull/AP\n\nThe punishment for military personnel convicted of arguably more serious crimes is often less than what Manning faces. In 2005, 24 unarmed Iraqi men, women and children were gunned down by a group of US marines in what became known as the Haditha killings. Charges were filed against eight marines, then dropped against seven. Murder charges against the remaining suspect, Frank Wuterich, were reduced to involuntary manslaughter and aggravated assault. Wuterich struck a deal with military prosecutors and pleaded guilty to one count of negligent dereliction of duty. He was sentenced to forfeit two-thirds of his pay for three months, and a reduction in rank to private.\n\nAldrich Ames\n\nThe US civilian courts have tended to give harsher sentences than their military counterparts. Ames, a 31-year veteran of the CIA, is one of the more famous espionage convicts.\n\nIn 1994, he was arrested and accused of spying for the Soviet Union since 1985. Ames was convicted of passing classified information about CIA and FBI \"human sources\" to the KGB and details of technical operations relating to the Soviet Union during his time in Turkey and Italy. Upon returning to the US, he continued to pass documents to the KGB; the CIA and FBI found their Russian sources were being executed. Ames was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nRobert Hanssen\n\nHanssen, a former FBI agent who was convicted in 2001 of spying for Moscow, was sentenced to 15 consecutive sentences of life in prison without the possibility of parole. He had first provided information to the Soviet Union in 1979 and had continued to divulge secrets \u2013 and the identities of agents\u2013 throughout the 1980s and 90s. Among Hanssen's crimes was giving up the identities of three KGB agents who were working for the US \u2013 two of them were executed. Hanssen was apparently unaware that all three had already been exposed by Ames.\n\nA government transparency advocate, Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists, said the sentences handed to Ames and Hanssen in civilian court were determined by their being career intelligence officers who had knowingly supplied foreign governments with US secrets over a number of years. In Ames's case, his disclosure led to two men being killed."}

Each day I will bring you a new player profile or topical article in the lead-up to the 2017 NHL Draft. Be sure to bookmark the site, follow me on Twitter, and spread the word for the site that will bring you analytical and critical profiles and scouting reports! Last Word On Hockey Prospects is your new headquarters for everything \"NHL Draft\"! We have a complete listing of our draft articles here.\n\nThe big day has come and gone, and now we look back to see how each team did in the NHL draft. Look, we know that it is way too soon to evaluate a draft and that the true evaluation will be seen four or five years from now. However, we don't want to wait, instead we follow our yearly tradition and do our draft grades now.\n\nLWOS 2017 NHL Draft Grades\n\nNote: We include trades in the grades. The moves for players like Travis Hamonic, Artemi Panarin, Brandon Saad, Derek Stepan, Brayden Schenn, Jordan Eberle, and others from the last week will be included in our draft grades.\n\nA second note: VALUE PICK does NOT mean best player drafted. It means best value. For Example, Nico Hischier was the first player taken in this draft. However he is not our best value pick for the Devils. Why? Because anyone can take the best player with the first overall pick, we are looking for value here, what steal did the team get in the draft that went later than we thought he would? If it was merely an exercise in naming the best player drafted, might as well just name the team's first pick, as that is who their own scouts felt was their best player.\n\nA third note: The links lead back to our scouting reports.\n\nAnaheim Ducks: B\n\nPicks: Maxime Comtois, Antoine Morand, Jack Badini, Kyle Olson, Olle Eriksson-Ek\n\nBest Value: Comtois\n\nThe Ducks got very good value when they drafted Comtois. He was once seen as a top five pick, but had a disappointing draft season. The thing with Comtois is that he started the season at wing and did not produce much. In December he was shifted back to centre and had good numbers. Antoine Morand is small but very skilled. He is playing centre now, but may end up as a winger going forward.\n\nBadini was passed over for the draft last year. While we aren't surprised that he was drafted, 91 seemed a bit early and a bit of a reach. Olson is another smaller player with skill. He plays like a buzz-saw though, as Olson is not afraid to mix things up in the corners or in front of the net. He also is talented enough to put up points. Eriksson-Ek gives the Ducks a nice goalie project to work with. He is the brother of Wild prospect Joel Eriksson Ek.\n\nArizona Coyotes: B +\n\nPicks: Pierre-Olivier Joseph, Filip Westerlund, MacKenzie Entwistle, Nate Schnarr, Cameron Crotty, Noel Hoefenmayer, Michael Karow, Tyler Steenbergen, Erik Walli-Walterholm\n\nTrades: Acquired Niklas Hjalmarsson, Acquired Derek Stepan and Antti Raanta\n\nBest Value: Hjalmarsson\n\nIt was an interesting weekend for the Coyotes. Long-time head coach Dave Tippett was shown the door. This was followed by a slew of trades. The Coyotes got excellent value in picking up Hjalmarsson. He's a solid defensive defenceman. They gave up Connor Murphy, whose contract is nearly as big as Hjalmarsson's. Centre Laurent Dauphin was passed by many on the Coyotes depth chart. They also picked up Stepan and Raanta. Stepan is proven top six centre and Raanta will be the team's new number one goalie. The seventh overall pick and Anthony DeAngelo was a big price. Given the age of the Coyotes team, getting proven talent, and the need to hit to the cap floor, this is decent value. The value in their Saturday trade down with the Flyers was great as well, getting two extra picks while moving nine spots.\n\nThe Coyotes also had a boatload of picks. We had Joseph lower than many others did, as we see a player who does a lot of things good, but does not have a standout skill. He could be a solid NHL contributor though, but most gain weight. Westerlund was also taken quite a bit higher than where we had hm as a mid third. These two picks keep them away from an A grade. They got good value later in the draft. Entwistle is"}

{"id": 259764, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Despite his invocation of socialist principles, Wang was quick to tell me that he dislikes the New Left label, even though he has used it himself. \"Intellectuals reacted against 'leftism' in the 80's, blaming it for all of China's problems,\" he said, \"and right-wing radicals use the words 'New Left' to discredit us, make us look like remnants from the Maoist days.\" Wang also doesn't care to be identified with the radical intellectuals of the 60's in America and Europe, to whom the term New Left was originally applied. Many of them, he said, had passion and slogans but very little practical politics, and not surprisingly, more than a few ended up with the neoconservatives, supporting \"fantasy projects\" like democracy in Iraq.\n\nWang prefers the term \"critical intellectual\" for himself and like-minded colleagues, some of whom are also part of China's nascent activist movement in the countryside, working to alleviate rural poverty and environmental damage. Though broadly left wing, Dushu publishes writing from across the ideological spectrum. Wang's own work draws on a broad range of Western thinkers, from the French historian Fernand Braudel to the globalization theorist Immanuel Wallerstein. \"Intellectual quality is important to me,\" Wang said. \"I don't want to run just any left-wing garbage.\" The magazine has carried abstract debates on postcolonial theory as well as, he claims, some of the most interesting analyses in China of how the government's urban-oriented reforms have damaged rural society. There are restrictions on what Dushu can publish, of course, and Wang is frank about them. As with all intellectual journals in mainland China, authors and editors at Dushu have to exercise a degree of self-censorship. Articles cannot directly criticize the leadership or deviate much from the official line on subjects that the Chinese government considers most sensitive \u2014 Taiwan or restive Muslim and Buddhist minorities in Xinjiang and Tibet.\n\n\"I get asked in Western countries, 'How do you define your position?\"' Wang said. \"'Are you a dissident?' I say no. What is a dissident? It is a cold-war category. And it has no meaning now. Many of the Chinese dissidents in America can return to China. But they don't want to. They are doing well in the U.S. To people who ask me if we are dissidents, I say, we are critical intellectuals. Some government policies we support. Others, we oppose. It really depends on the content of the policy.\"\n\nBorn in Yangzhou in the southeast province of Jiangsu, Wang was just 7 and entering primary school when the Cultural Revolution began in 1966. The decade-long chaos, which traumatized older generations, seems to have left benign memories for Wang. He remembers being taken by his school to work in the villages for a week or two during the school year. \"My generation of urban intellectuals,\" he said, with a hint of pride, \"is the last to have firsthand experience of conditions in the countryside.\"\n\nHe counts the 20 months he spent working in factories around Yangzhou after middle school as a valuable experience. In 1977, he took the first university entrance exams to be held after the Cultural Revolution, during which many universities were either shut or would admit only peasants, workers and soldiers. \"Thousands of aspiring students,\" he reminisced, \"were competing for a single place.\"\n\nWhen he moved from Yangzhou to Beijing to begin his doctoral studies in the mid-80's, Wang found himself part of an even more privileged class. \"Intellectuals,\" he said, \"had been targeted during Mao's time; now, post-Mao, they were the elite again.\" And by then, Wang said, they all agreed on what needed to be done: China had to abandon its \"feudal\" and socialist traditions and catch up with the capitalist West. Scarred by the Cultural Revolution, intellectuals saw socialism in China as a failure. Consequently, they had, Wang argues, no real debate on whether a Western-style consumerist society could be successfully recreated or was environmentally sustainable in China. The West, especially the United States, was idealized.\n\nWang first began to develop his own views on contemporary China while working on a dissertation about one of the most admired of modern Chinese writers, Lu Xun (1881 1936). Lu Xun, Wang explained to me, was a writer of the left, but he was very critical of left-wing writers and activists. He criticized Chinese tradition, but was also an excellent classical scholar. He welcomed the Western idea of progress, but was also skeptical of it. The paradoxes in Lu Xun helped Wang to see that Chinese modernity could not be a simple matter of abandoning the old and embracing the new \u2014 as it had been for both Maoists and free-market capitalists.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nFor Wang, the problems associated with China's uneven development were"}

Objective: To address this discrepancy, we compared the effects of consuming glucose, fructose, or high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) at 25% of energy requirements (E) on risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Participants, Design and Setting, and Intervention: Forty-eight adults (aged 18\u201340 yr; body mass index 18\u201335 kg/m2) resided at the Clinical Research Center for 3.5 d of baseline testing while consuming energy-balanced diets containing 55% E complex carbohydrate. For 12 outpatient days, they consumed usual ad libitum diets along with three servings per day of glucose, fructose, or HFCS-sweetened beverages (n = 16/group), which provided 25% E requirements. Subjects then consumed energy-balanced diets containing 25% E sugar-sweetened beverages/30% E complex carbohydrate during 3.5 d of inpatient intervention testing. Main Outcome Measures: Twenty-four-hour triglyceride area under the curve, fasting plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and apolipoprotein B (apoB) concentrations were measured. Results: Twenty-four-hour triglyceride area under the curve was increased compared with baseline during consumption of fructose (+4.7 \u00b1 1.2 mmol/liter \u00d7 24 h, P = 0.0032) and HFCS (+1.8 \u00b1 1.4 mmol/liter \u00d7 24 h, P = 0.035) but not glucose (\u22121.9 \u00b1 0.9 mmol/liter \u00d7 24 h, P = 0.14). Fasting LDL and apoB concentrations were increased during consumption of fructose (LDL: +0.29 \u00b1 0.082 mmol/liter, P = 0.0023; apoB: +0.093 \u00b1 0.022 g/liter, P = 0.0005) and HFCS (LDL: +0.42 \u00b1 0.11 mmol/liter, P < 0.0001; apoB: +0.12 \u00b1 0.031 g/liter, P < 0.0001) but not glucose (LDL: +0.012 \u00b1 0.071 mmol/liter, P = 0.86; apoB: +0.0097 \u00b1 0.019 g/liter, P = 0.90). Conclusions: Consumption of HFCS-sweetened beverages for 2 wk at 25% E increased risk factors for cardiovascular disease comparably with fructose and more than glucose in young adults.\n\nIn epidemiological studies, consumption of sugar and/or sugar-sweetened beverages has been linked to the presence of unfavorable lipid levels (1\u20135), insulin resistance (6, 7), fatty liver (8, 9), type 2 diabetes (10\u201312), cardiovascular disease (13), and metabolic syndrome (14). We have recently reported that consumption of fructose-sweetened beverages at 25% of energy requirements (E) increased visceral adipose deposition and de novo lipogenesis, produced dyslipidemia, and decreased glucose tolerance/insulin sensitivity in older, overweight/obese men and women, whereas consumption of glucose-sweetened beverages did not (15). Because the commonly consumed sugars, sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), are composed of 50\u201355% fructose, these results provide a potential mechanistic explanation for the associations between sugar consumption and metabolic disease. However, the adverse metabolic effects of fructose consumption observed in the older, overweight/obese population (15) may not occur in a younger, leaner population.\n\nAuthors of three recent reviews have concluded that long-term sugar intakes as high as 25\u201350% E have no adverse effects with respect to components of metabolic syndrome (16) and that fructose consumption up to 140 g/d does not result in biologically relevant increases of fasting or postprandial triglycerides (TG) in healthy, normal-weight (17), or overweight or obese (18) humans. These reviews (16, 17) are cited in the Report of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2010, released June of 2010, in which a maximal intake level of 25% or less of total energy from added sugars is suggested (19). However, in August of 2009, the American Heart Association Nutrition Committee recommended that women consume no more than 100 kcal/d and men consume no more than 150 kcal/d of added sugar (20). This equates to differences between the two guidelines of 400 kcal/d for women consuming 2000 kcal/d and 525 kcal/d for men consuming 2500 kcal/d. To address this discrepancy, we compared the effects of consuming 25%E as glucose, fructose or HFCS for 2 weeks"}

And why does everyone care about it all of a sudden?\n\nAs of now, net neutrality is shorthand for the internet as we know it. It's the idea and tradition that internet service providers (ISPs) will not discriminate or charge differently based on content, website, or platform\u2013and essentially that ISPs must provide the same version of the internet to everyone regardless of their location, political opinion, or internet consumption habits.\n\nThough generally understood as more of a principle than anything, it wouldn't be entirely inaccurate to say that it's the present state of the law. The FCC officially regulates ISPs and in 2015 classified them as \"common carriers\" under Title II of the 1934 Communications Act and Section 706 of the 1996 Telecommunications Act in order to preserve the neutrality of the network we call the internet.\n\nCommon carrier status effectively means ISPs are treated similar to phone companies and other utilities; therefore they must keep the internet an open and neutral gateway to the content contained online. Effectively, this means ISPs can't speed up or slow down access to certain content or throttle users' bandwidth just because they feel like it.\n\nHere are a few examples of what a compromised (i.e. non-neutral) network might look like:\n\n1. The illicit behavior of Comcast in 2007. The ISP was secretly throttling the bandwidth of users who were uploading to peer-to-peer file sharing services like BitTorrent; once this behavior was discovered by the FCC, Comcast was ordered to stop.\n\n2. The illegal 2004 activity of Madison River Communications, a phone company which was blocking users' ability to access competitor Vonage's internet-based phone services. They were fined $15,000 by the FCC.\n\n3. AT&T got in on the unlawful action in 2012: limiting access to Apple's FaceTime app to those customers who purchased a more expensive data plan. They eventually backed down before the FCC was forced to act.\n\n4. Not to be outdone, Verizon in 2007 decided to censor pro-choice text messages sent across their SMS network. This decision was swiftly criticized across the political spectrum\u2013and then swiftly reversed.\n\nNet neutrality, therefore, in its present state, is a regulation intended to curb potential abuses of corporate power by ISPs who seek to offer tiered pricing, regulate political content they might disagree with, or single-out certain users or applications and deny them access.\n\nThe extent of the FCC's authority over ISPs, however, is an open question currently subject to varied legal wrangling on all sides of the issue. Thus, net neutrality is in an ever-precarious state of being. Which brings us to today.\n\nPresident Trump's appointed FCC Chairman, Ajit Pai, began the process of compromising net neutrality just a few months after taking office.\n\nIn a 2-1 vote along partisan lines\u2013the FCC is nonsensically straitjacketed by a rule that no more than three of its five members may come from the same political party\u2013earlier this year, the FCC decided to review the Obama-era policy on net neutrality.\n\n[image via ; video courtesy The Hill]\n\nFollow Colin Kalmbacher on Twitter: @colinkalmbacher"}

(1989) reported a 16-year-old boy with severe mental retardation, microcephaly, and craniofacial dysmorphism associated with an interstitial deletion of chromosome 2q32.2-q33.1. He had no comprehensible speech and was totally dependent for all activities. Facial features included large beaked nose, ptosis, and cleft palate. He also had seizures and a striking scalloped skin pigmentation that did not follow Blaschko lines. Activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1; 147700) was normal.\n\nVan Buggenhout et al. (2005) reported 4 unrelated patients with interstitial deletions of chromosome 2q32-q33. Common clinical features included pre- and postnatal growth retardation, severe mental retardation, thin and sparse hair, persistent feeding difficulties, inguinal hernia, and broad-based gait. Facial features included high long face, high forehead, ptosis, dacrocystitis, high nasal bridge, small mouth, teeth abnormalities, micrognathia, and cleft or high-arched palate. Two patients had seizures, and 3 had spasticity and contractures. Three patients had a specific behavioral phenotype with hyperactivity and motor restlessness, chaotic behavior, and happy personality intermixed with periods of aggression and anxiety, sleeping problems and self-mutilation. Array CGH and FISH analysis showed that all patients shared an 8.1-Mb minimal deleted region. The cleft or high-arched palate most likely resulted from hemizygosity for the SATB2 gene (608148).\n\nRosenfeld et al. (2009) reported 3 unrelated patients with small heterozygous deletions of chromosome 2q33.1, ranging from 173.1 to 185.2 kb, that affected only the SATB2 gene. Parental samples from the mother were available for only 2 patients, and neither mother carried the deletion; parental samples were not available for the third patient. All patients had severe developmental delay, mental retardation, and tooth anomalies, but other features varied. Dentofacial anomalies included delayed primary dentition and micrognathia in 1 patient; cleft palate, crowded teeth, and small mandible in the second; and fused mandibular central incisors without cleft palate in the third. Two patients had behavioral abnormalities and mild dysmorphic features. Rosenfeld et al. (2009) concluded that haploinsufficiency for SATB2 is responsible for some of the clinical features associated with the 2q32-q33 deletion syndrome.\n\nUrquhart et al. (2009) reported a girl with a de novo heterozygous 4.5-Mb microdeletion of chromosome 2q33.1. She had cleft soft palate, feeding problems, febrile seizures, and delayed psychomotor development with poor speech. She was mildly dysmorphic, with broad forehead, flat philtrum, small mouth, thin upper lip, missing lateral incisors, and relative macrocephaly, but ears were normal. She also had joint laxity, valgus foot deformity, broad toes and thumbs, brachydactyly, and contractures of the fourth and fifth fingers. She had a social disposition. Brain MRI showed nonspecific periventricular white matter abnormalities. The deleted region included the SATB2 gene.\n\nRifai et al. (2010) reported a 16-year-old girl, born of unrelated French Caribbean parents, with an interstitial 26.3-Mb deletion of chromosome 2q31.2-q33.2. She had prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism, cleft palate, camptodactyly, bilateral talipes equinovarus, severe intellectual disability, and ectodermal anomalies. Ectodermal anomalies included thin, atrophic skin, sparse, brittle, slowly growing hair, oligodontia with abnormally shaped teeth, normal sweating, and normal fingernails. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of ectodermal dysplasia. The deletion resulted in hemizygosity for the HOXD gene (see, e.g., HOXD1; 142987) cluster and its regulatory elements, which may affect limb development. Haploinsufficiency of other genes such as COL3A1 (120180)/COL5A2 (120190), GTF3C3 (604888), CASP8 (601763), CASP10 (601762), and SATB2 may also influence the phenotype.\n\nBalasubramanian et al.

Go to Data \u2013> Sort and Filter \u2013> Filter. This will apply a filter to all the headers. Click on any of the filter drop-downs. Go to 'Filter by Color' and select the color. In the above dataset, since there are two colors used for highlighting the cells, the filter shows two colors to filter these cells.\n\nAs soon as you filter the cells, you will notice that the value in the SUBTOTAL function changes and returns only the number of cells that are visible after filtering.\n\nHow does this work?\n\nThe SUBTOTAL function uses 102 as the first argument, which is used to count visible cells (hidden rows are not counted) in the specified range.\n\nIf the data if not filtered it returns 19, but if it is filtered, then it only returns the count of the visible cells.\n\nTry it Yourself.. Download the Example File\n\n\n#2 Count Colored Cells Using GET.CELL Function\n\nGET.CELL is a Macro4 function that has been kept due to compatibility reasons.\n\nIt does not work if used as regular functions in the worksheet.\n\nHowever, it works in Excel named ranges.\n\nSee Also: Know more about GET.CELL function.\n\nHere are the three steps to use GET.CELL to count colored cells in Excel:\n\nCreate a Named Range using GET.CELL function\n\nUse the Named Range to get color code in a column\n\nUsing the Color Number to Count the number of Colored Cells (by color)\n\nLet's deep dive and see what to do in each of the three mentioned steps.\n\nCreating a Named Range\n\nGo to Formulas \u2013> Define Name.\n\nIn the New Name dialog box, enter: Name: GetColor Scope: Workbook Refers to:\n\nas the second argument. You need to use the reference of the column where you have the cells with the background color. Sheet1!$A2 In the above formula, I have used =GET.CELL(38,Sheet1!$A2)\n\n\nGetting the Color Code for Each Cell\n\nIn the cell adjacent to the data, use the formula =GetColor\n\nThis formula would return 0 if there is NO background color in a cell and would return a specific number if there is a background color.\n\nThis number is specific to a color, so all the cells with the same background color get the same number.\n\nCount Colored Cells using the Color Code\n\nIf you follow the above process, you would have a column with numbers corresponding to the background color in it.\n\nTo get the count of a specific color:\n\nSomewhere below the dataset, give the same background color to a cell that you want to count. Make sure you are doing this in the same column that you used in creating the named range. For example, I used Column A, and hence I will use the cells in column 'A' only.\n\nIn the adjacent cell, use the following formula:\n\n=COUNTIF($F$2:$F$20,GetColor)\n\nThis formula will give you the count of all the cells with the specified background color.\n\nHow Does It Work?\n\nThe COUNTIF function uses the named range (GetColor) as the criteria. The named range in the formula refers to the adjacent cell on the left (in column A) and returns the color code for that cell. Hence, this color code number is the criteria.\n\nThe COUNTIF function uses the range ($F$2:$F$18) which holds the color code numbers of all the cells and returns the count based"}

Our loved-up friends gushing over their flowers, chocolates and slushy texts from their partners are just another reminder of how unromantic our lives are. But do not fear, online dating is here! And a new study provides some tips that could help you find the love of your life.\n\n\nA username beginning with a letter in the first half of the alphabet could bring you closer to finding a date online, according to the study. A username beginning with a letter in the first half of the alphabet could bring you closer to finding a date online, according to the study.\n\nMore than 40 million Americans have tried online dating. While some people are lucky enough to get a date within days of signing up, it can be weeks or months before other users even generate any interest. So where are they going wrong?\n\nMany of you may be thinking that an attractive photo and a good headline message are bound to gain interest on dating sites, and you are right. But according to new research published in Evidence Based Medicine - a journal of The BMJ - your username is just as important.\n\nThe research team, including Prof. Khalid Khan of the Queen Mary University of London in the UK, found that choosing a screen name that begins with a letter in the first half of the alphabet may lead to greater success with online dating.\n\nAccording to the researchers - who reached their findings by analyzing almost 4,000 studies that investigated the art of attraction and persuasion - this is because people associate names beginning with letters higher in the alphabet with measures of success, such as income and educational attainment.\n\n\"Search engine listings are also sorted alphabetically: screen names starting with a letter near the top of the alphabet are presented first,\" the authors note. \"Those in the lower quarter of the alphabet will be lost in the bottom of the pile if you start at the top.\"\n\nThe researchers also found that people are more likely to respond to positive usernames, such as \"Fun2bwith,\" but are more likely to avoid usernames associated with negativity. \"Names with negative connotations - such as 'Little' or 'Bugg' - are often associated with inferiority,\" they explain. \"Playful screen names are universally attractive.\"\n\nIn addition, the team found that men are more likely to be drawn to usernames that indicate physical attractiveness, such as \"Cutie\" or \"Blondie,\" while women are more attracted to usernames that suggest intelligence, such as \"Cultured.\"\n\nProfile pictures: more than meets the eye\n\nIt is well established that having an attractive profile picture is important for generating interest on dating sites, but according to the study, you should focus on more than just your hair or makeup.\n\nThe researchers found that people are more likely to respond to those with profile pictures that feature a genuine smile that crinkles up the eyes, and a slight head tilt can boost attractiveness. In addition, they found men appear to be more attracted to women who wear red in their picture.\n\nA group photo can also generate interest, according to the team, and standing in the middle can generate a sense of importance that is attractive to other users.\n\n\"This can be further enhanced in group photos where you are shown touching another person - confining this to the upper arm to be socially acceptable,\" they add. \"This is because a toucher is perceived to be of higher status than the one touched.\"\n\nFurthermore, they found that women are more attracted to a man in a photo when they see other women smiling at him.\n\nComplex language will not make you appear more intelligent\n\nThe headline message on a user profile is equally as important as the photo and username, according to the researchers, but many people make the mistake of using complex words in an attempt to make themselves sound more intelligent. This should be avoided.\n\nThe researchers explain:\n\n\"Simple language, not overcomplicated wording, is likely to result in significantly higher ratings of intelligence because people are naturally drawn to words that are easy to remember and pronounce. It makes information-processing easier, which also increases likeability.\"\n\nThe team adds that increasing interest in the headline message also increases exposure to the profile picture, which will make the individual appear more likable.\n\nA \"good sense of humor\" seems to be a staple in a dating profile. But the researchers say more interest is generated through a \"show\" rather than a \"tell\" approach. \"A profile written in a humorous, clever manner will be seen as more credible evidence of a sense of humor than the use of the words 'I am hilarious,'\" they add.\n\nAs a general rule, the researchers say a user profile should have a balance of \"comprehensive honesty and positive self-presentation.\" After all, any lies or exaggerations are likely to be exposed in"}
{"id": 259771, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "The promotion for Wrestlemania 28 was centered around \"Once in a Lifetime\", the tagline for the main event match pitting the current generation's poster boy, John Cena, against the golden ticket of yesteryear and A-List movie star, The Rock. It wasn't difficult to see how this angle was a winner for WWE, and was reminiscent of a similar concept 11 years earlier featuring The Rock and Hulk Hogan. Last year's build-up was entertaining indeed, but the match itself left something to be desired. Ultimately, it was a nice little ride but we were glad when it was over.\n\nWhen a possible path to a second Wrestlemania encounter between Cena and Rock was laid before our eyes after Dwayne Johnson announced his intentions last summer to once again become WWE Champion at this January's Royal Rumble, I couldn't help but gasp in sheer horror. Of course, CM Punk was the champ at the time and in the midst of what would eventually become a historic 434 day reign, but it was clear that the eventual showdown several months later would allow The Rock to relieve him of his title holding duties. After all, WWE wouldn't have had The Rock make such a bold claim if they weren't going to put the belt on him at some point.\n\nThere were still a slew of options possible for this year's Wrestlemania main event, many which involved Punk, but the one that kept staring us in the face for months, with The Rock acquiring the championship and John Cena winning the Royal Rumble, causing the rematch and the least interesting of the bunch, is what we ultimately got stuck with.\n\nBefore we even get into Wrestlemania 29, what is really irking about this whole situation is that we were basically lied to for a year. All of the hype, the promos, the video packages\u2026hell even the DVD they released on \"Once in a Lifetime\" is a total sham. To WWE, it doesn't matter at this point; they got their money from the fans from that match. But when we look back years from now, in a business where nostalgia carries as much weight in terms of the overall fun as the present, it won't hold an ounce of water.\n\nSo what does this all mean for this year's 'Mania and why is it so bad? For starters, it signifies that we're about to get the most predictable outcome for a main event in history. As previously mentioned, John Cena is the guy for WWE. Whereas last year's hype was drawn from The Rock as a conquering hero returning to former glory, this time around the build is based on Cena's redemption and getting back to the mountain top. That doesn't just include losing on last year's big stage, but almost the entire year since then. For a mat has held the title numerous times, it has been far too long for the company to not have him as their champion. Obviously, he is going to win.\n\nAnd, oh yeah, there's the fact that The Rock came out victorious last year and will be leaving to film yet another movie afterward. WWE is practically lobbing us a batting practice fastball here.\n\nWhat is even more troubling is that The Rock, the man holding the WWE Championship, has been on television only part-time during the build to the rematch of what was dubbed the biggest match of all time. Granted, I understand that Dwayne Johnson is getting paid millions of dollars to be in other countries on Monday nights to shoot movie scenes. I also grasp the concept that Vince McMahon wants to have him carry around the belt all over the world to draw publicity for WWE. As a business move, it is hard to argue against it. Despite that, you can't have the top guy, the champion of your company, miss half of the televised shows after he wins the title in the lead up to your biggest show of the year.\n\nSimply put, it's embarrassing. After last year, it is an act that is getting very, very old. I don't know if the March 18th Raw crowd in Pittsburgh is a good indicator (considering how dead and awful they were all night), but when The Rock was mentioned, a moment that always draws a tremendous pop from the fans, it wasn't met with the same enthusiasm as usual, and even a smattering of jeers made their way through. Perhaps it was an anomaly, but I wouldn't be surprised if people are finally starting to get tired of this \"here one week, gone the next\" shtick.\n\nPossibly the worst part of this entire situation is that we are going to have to sit through this match again, a match that was below average at best the first time around. If it were a couple of other guys, I might have faith it would be better. But with two limited in-ring performers as it is, I'm not holding my breath.\n\nFurthermore, unless if something earth-shattering happens, we're looking at the same style ending as last year, just the total reverse with"}

(Ben Nelms/The Canadian Press via AP)\n\nLocal beat writers like to joke the Anaheim Ducks are the most interesting team in the NHL.\n\nIn the last couple years, the team has experienced everything from the mumps to illegal bear poaching to a player testing positive for performance enhancing drugs to their captain needing an immediate appendectomy while on the road. Oh, and how about the franchise's beloved Finnish legend slamming the current coach in his book right before the start of training camp a season ago?\n\nThe list goes on, and we haven't even come to what's happened on the ice.\n\nAnaheim had steadily developed into the role the San Jose Sharks have held over the years: the team with a ton of talent that underperforms come playoff time -- the hallmark of a Bruce Boudreau coached team. Each of the last three postseasons, the Ducks went a round further than they had the year before, only to stink it up in Game 7 of the series.\n\nComing into this season, they were projected by many to represent the Western Conference in the Stanley Cup. Fitting considering their playoff pattern. Those were pretty high expectations. The players said they didn't feel it, but how could they not? Their record reflected it as the season wore on.\n\nTo put it kindly, the team was so bafflingly average.\n\nDespite the coach being widely agreed upon to not be the issue with the team, #BruceWatch was a nightly occurrence. Bruce Boudreau's days in Anaheim appeared to be numbered.\n\nIt wasn't until the Christmas break when the team's reclusive general manager, Bob Murray, emerged to talk about his team. He made it clear: he wasn't going to fire Boudreau. Murray put the team's struggles squarely on the shoulders of his players. The GM went out of his way to say there were veteran players who arrived at camp not in shape.\n\nWhile Murray didn't name names, it didn't take a seasoned reporter to connect the dots. The guy he was (probably) addressing was Ryan Getzlaf. The team's captain had a whopping 1 goal and 19 assists through 29 games. Through the same span last season, he had 8 goals and 21 assists.\n\nGetzlaf's bad season was multiplied further by the struggles of the players tapped to replace depth scoring provided by now-former Ducks Kyle Palmieri and Matt Beleskey.\n\nFollowing Murray's remarks, the team won the next three games, and by December 31 their record improved to 15-15-6.\n\nThe calendar turned to 2016 and the Ducks began to resemble the team we thought they were going to be all along. Since New Year's Day, Anaheim has a 15-4-4 record. As of Friday night, they're second in the Pacific Division, only one point ahead of the third place San Jose Sharks and only two points behind the Los Angeles Kings. (All three California teams should count their blessings that the Pacific is hot garbage this season.)\n\nTeams who see a massive turnaround usually can point to one moment that made the difference. For the Ducks, that moment was a trade. Well, a trade to make up for a trade that didn't work.\n\nCarl Hagelin was acquired by the Ducks from the New York Rangers for Emerson Etem in the off-season as a part of Murray's plan to ice a faster team and later signed a four year, $16-million RFA contract.\n\nHowever, seeing the Kings kicking ass and taking names gave GMBM a revelation. His boys needed to get bigger, and go back to a style of play that was less finesse, as the cliche goes, getting goals from the 'dirty areas' in front of the net. Hagelin simply didn't fit in with that style. Through 43 games with the Anaheim, he had only 12 points.\n\nSo last month Murray flipped Hagelin to the Pittsburgh Penguins for David Perron. Somehow, Murray fleeced Jim Rutherford again (see: Lovejoy for Despres), convincing him to take on Hagelin's deal for Perron's expiring contract.\n\nThrough 14 games with Anaheim, Perron has 6 goals and 7 assists. His offensive contribution is welcomed, but he provided a spark to someone that needed it \u2013 Ryan Getzlaf.\n\nIn the 14 games since Perron's arrival, Getzlaf has 4 goals and 15 assists. The line combination of Getzlaf, Perron, and Chris Stewart were the top producing trio prior to Stewart's fractured jaw. Mike Santorelli has found his scoring touch filling in for Stewart with four points is his last three games."}

I didn't want to drown in this sweater (my sheep one, unfortunately, has stretched with time and someone not long ago mistook it for a dress, which is not how I intended it--not into the shapeless sweater look!!) so I figured I could sub worsted for bulky and go down two needle sizes.\n\n12/22: All the charts are FINALLY done, and I sewed in the majority of the loose ends. Finishing on projects like this is so daunting--I still have to seam the underarms and shoulders (kind of, my shoulders ended up wonky). I like set-in sleeves better, esp. for colorwork projects where you can see the floats between the raglan decreases, so I considered rewriting the pattern, but laziness and a desire to wear the sweater took over.\n\nThese amazing charts are too fabulous, but I was not wowed by the quality of the knitting instructions, especially for the price of the pattern. Will make better notes on potential mods/issues once I finish.\n\n12/23: DONE OMG IT'S BEAUTIFUL. I'm so glad I went down two needle sizes from suggested and used worsted; it fits like a glove. Just need to steam it into submission and will get pics!\n\n12/28: No project is truly done without pics, so here they are. I ended up having to reinforce the decrease line between the sleeves and body because I thought it looked sloppy. I think if I knit this again I would just do set-in sleeves. I have so much midnight heather left, I need to figure out something to do with it all.\n\nGauge: 5 st = 1 in. in pattern on US 8\n\nMeasurements of finished sweater:\n\n-length from bottom edge to beginning of armhole: 17.5\"\n\n-circumference: 35\" (17.5\" front and back after blocking, no ease)\n\n-length from bottom edge to center neck below the ribbing: 20\"\n\n-length from bottom edge to top of left and right shoulders: 24\"\n\nThe ribbing at the bottom edge is 3\" long. The neck ribbing is 1.5\" but was rather improvised, so I do not remember how many I picked up or how I decreased for it.\n\nMods:\n\n-Disregarded the initials at the bottom of the chart. Did not want.\n\n-Made the neck ribbing longer and added some decreases so that it would not be a boatneck.\n\n-Reinforced decrease line between arms and body.\n\n-Worked the right sleeve in MC stranding so that the gauge would be similar to the left.\n\n-Added three extra rounds of ribbing at hips to make sweater hang better.\n\nThings you might find weird about this pattern:\n\n-The yoke chart works, but it is very strange, because you have to follow it in a circle. I didn't find it overly difficult, but I wasn't too concerned with following it exactly.\n\n-As someone else mentioned, the raglan decreases come every row instead of every other row, which created an exaggerated gap between arms and body. Ended up having to seam around the decrease line so that it looked neat, otherwise there would've been visible floats.\n\n-The way the neckband is written lends itself to a boat neck or (worst case scenario) a floppy neck, so if you want a traditional sweater neck you may need to increase the length of the ribbing.\n\nYes, this pattern is expensive. Ordinarily I wouldn't pay so much for a pattern, particularly an imperfect one, but it's incredibly beautiful. The chart is a work of art. I prefer to look at it as, \"Could I ever buy a sweater like this, that fits me so well, for less than $50 total cost to me?\" (what I paid total for materials + pattern in this case, not counting labor hours, since it's for me and I would've spent those hours watching TV anyway).

Well, you should never say \"never,\" but for the hopeful Wii U owners out there, both Epic and DICE have confirmed that Nintendo's newest platform really isn't their primary focus right now. That is to say, the Unreal Engine 4 and Frostbite 3 aren't catering to the Wii U.\n\nConsidering the Wii U is pretty much the same generation as the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, the revelation really isn't much of one. On the subject, Epic Games' co-founder Mark Rein explained that they simply aren't aiming for the current era of \"PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, or Wii U. It's next-gen technology.\" And that's where their aim is set.\n\nAs it stands, Epic can boast that the Unreal Engine 3 remains the best non-Nintendo engine for the Wii U. So when it comes to the Unreal Engine 4, Epic really wants to keep their eyes ahead on the fast-approaching next generation. Rein said:\n\n\"The truth is, if a developer wanted to take an Unreal Engine game and put it on Wii U, they could. Unreal Engine 3 is kicking ass on Wii U. The best games on Wii U are made on our technology. What more do you want from us?\"\n\nDICE has the same outlook when it comes to Frostbite 3 and Wii U support. Battlefield's Patrick Bach did a fair job of explaining things from a developer's perspective. Concerning Frostbite and the Wii U, he remarked:\n\n\"The biggest problem we have right now is we don't want to back down from what we see as our low spec machines. We right now don't have support for the Wii U in the Frostbite engine. The reason for that is it takes development time. What should we focus on to create the best possible Battlefield experience? We are now focused on PC and the current-gen platforms, and then there might be other platforms in the future that we can't talk about...\"\n\nDICE has already confirmed that Battlefield 4 won't be released to Wii U. Recently, BioWare did announce that Dragon Age III and the next Mass Effect would both be running on Frostbite 3.\n\nIf you're curious to see exactly what Epic's Unreal Engine 4 can do, the studio has been eager to show it off in tech demos. The most recent one, seen at GDC, will undoubtedly leave you breathless.\n\nUpdate (3/31/2013): Just to be clear, the Unreal Engine 4 can run on current-gen hardware, even if Epic is choosing to focus on next-gen.

Perhaps this has helped to bring about a perception that people cycle out of choice and not necessity; that their journeys could be easily supplanted with a trip by car or on the Tube if conditions are unfavourable; but as cycling rates grow in London so will the profile of its cyclists and we could soon find ourselves with a new \"cycling tribe\"; one that is very poor indeed. This week sees the overhaul of England's social welfare system and unless you've been living under a rock you won't have been able to escape all of the media chatter about benefits and the so-called bedroom tax.\u00a0 In the coming years poorer people within our society are likely to find themselves initially less well off; its claimed that inner city poorer people will move to cheaper suburban areas and poorer people with limited mobility already living in suburban areas could have to give up running a car .\u00a0 Government minister Iain Duncan Smith may think it is possible to live off \u00a353 a week , but most people would struggle and be looking to make economies where it is possible.\u00a0 With diesel fuel currently costing around \u00a31.40p a litre and a one day Zone 1-4 Transport for London Travelcard coming in at \u00a311, or \u00a343.50 for a week, the bicycle makes the most sensible choice for people with decreasing incomes to get around.\nHow will the profile of London's cyclists change in the coming years? Transport consultants Steer Davies Gleave recently released a discussion document outlining how cycling levels will grow across London in the forthcoming years.\u00a0 A \"contagion\" effect will see cycling growth ripple out from boroughs with already high levels of cycling, such as Hackney, whilst new centres for cycling will grow in the outer London boroughs.\u00a0 Outer London locations with no cycling to work will decrease to 7% down from 42% in 2001, based on projections modeled on 2001 and 2011 Census data, whilst across the capital 95% of locations will include people who cycle to work, compared to just 66% in 2001. Cycling to work levels across London in 2011:\nProjected cycling to work levels across London in 2021;\nAs more people turn to using a bicycle as the most economic mode of transport as a consequence of their personal financial situation, we should expect to see people from a wider spectrum of London's society riding.\u00a0 Very cheap second-hand bicycles and sub-\u00a350 supermarket bikes will become as ubiquitous as City racers on high-end road bikes.\u00a0 People will begin to use bikes more in poorer outer London areas where previously there was little or no bicycle use at all.\u00a0 Using a bicycle out of necessity rather than by choice means you are less likely to be able to afford to switch transport modes in the event of inclement weather; we can expect to see more people riding through winter, riding in the dark and riding in wet and extreme-weather conditions.\u00a0 Most people I know who currently ride do so because they have a certain passion for bikes, a love of the ride, but this emerging new sub-group of cyclists will have a different approach.\u00a0 Many will feel they have no choice but to ride, as alternatives are untenable - as pointed out in the now defunct Sustainable Development Commission's excellent report Fairness in a Car Dependant Society ; \"The cost of public transport alternatives to car ownership have risen substantially in real terms over the last decade, while in many cases services have worsened. A transport system that offers only limited and expensive public transport options can exacerbate unemployment issues. The Social Exclusion Unit's report found two out of five jobseekers stated that lack of transport is a barrier to getting a job and the two most common problems for young jobseekers were \"lack of personal transport\" and \"no job nearby\".\u00a0 For those currently hoping to move off benefits, transport problems can be a major worry. Research for the Department for Work and Pensions found: \"Of all the factors associated with concern about moving off benefit, one (access to transportation) stood out as especially important in predicting anxiety.\" (page 26)\nDrawing Rings data blog's heat map of cycling collisions in central London show that the \"hottest\" areas are also some of the poorest; Elephant and Castle, Whitechapel and the Euston Road feature strongly alongside more \"traditionally dangerous\" corners of the capital such as Blackfriars and Trafalgar Square.\u00a0 Conversely, some of these areas are perceived to be poorer areas because of the way in which they are blighted by motor traffic, which in"}

An enormous outbreak in Florida is now fouling beaches on the east coast, and a 2014 outbreak at Lake Erie left more than 400,000 people in the Toledo area without tap water for two days.\n\nUtah Lake doesn't provide drinking water, but its closure is causing big problems for people who use the lake for swimming, fishing and other activities, and for farmers with thirsty crops.\n\nUtah poison control says it has fielded hundreds of calls related to the bloom, including 130 involving people who have reported vomiting, diarrhea, headache and rashes.\n\nThe contamination has now spread to the Jordan river, which supplies irrigation to dozens of farmers around Salt Lake City, about 45 miles north of the lake. The problem has occurred amid days of triple-digit temperatures as growers prepare for farmers markets and try to nurture crops such as corn and fruit trees at key points in their development.\n\n\"We've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on this crop, maxed out every dollar we have,\" said Luke Petersen, who farms about 100 acres of tomatoes, summer squash and other produce in Riverton. \"We're real worried about it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Bonneville School of Sailing has had to cancel more than a dozen groups since the lake was closed.\n\n\"This will be a real hit,\" said co-owner Todd Frye. He loves the mountain-rimmed lake and has worked to change the decades-old perception that it's murky and polluted. New efforts to clean out bottom-feeding carp are improving the water quality, but he worries the algae bloom will be a blow to its image.\n\nThe lake is largely fed by treated wastewater as well as agricultural runoff, said Erica Gaddis, assistant director for the Utah division of water quality.\n\nLongstanding drought conditions have made the water especially low and stagnant. Combine that with hot summer weather and Utah Lake became a perfect petri dish for the cyanobacteria.\n\nThere are chemical and biological treatments for the problem, but using them on such a large bloom would be unprecedented and possibly harmful, Gaddis said.\n\nFor now, authorities are waiting for the bloom to run its course and clear, hopefully aided by a drop in temperatures or a storm that could stir up the water and reduce stagnation.\n\nOne bit of good news is that early test results indicate levels of dangerous toxins produced by the bacteria may not be as high as feared, though the state is still waiting for more data.\n\nTo stave off new blooms in coming years, the state is looking to reduce the levels of toxic algae-feeding phosphorous and nitrogen in wastewater that's pumped into the lake. That could be difficult, however, because cities served by those plants include some of the fastest-growing in the nation.\n\n\"We've been loading the Utah Lake in one form or another for 150 years, and it's catching up with us,\" Gaddis said."}

Gone are the restrictions on traded-in games.\n\nAnd perhaps best of all for Australian gamers, gone are the arbitrary restrictions of region coding.\n\nSince the dawn of the original Xbox, Microsoft has restricted the games that the console can play depending on where you live.\n\nBut as part of Don Mattrick's Xbox One 80 announcement came confirmation that regional restrictions have gone the way of\u2026 Well, the way of the Xbox One's daily Internet check-in.\n\nWhile Australia has managed to get away with playing games from the UK thanks to shared region coding, the Xbox One will be the first Microsoft console to let Australian gamers buy games online from places like America and Japan.\n\nSave a buck, save the world\n\nThis is a big deal. Despite Microsoft confirming that One games will cost the same as their 360 counterparts, the fact remains that the price of games varies greatly around the world.\n\nFor Australians, who regularly face recommended retail prices of $120 a game (compared to $US70) in America), this is a very convenient way of saving some money on a games library.\n\nEven with shipping, in many cases it's cheaper to buy a game from the US than it is to pick it up from the local EB Games store.\n\nAnd while many pundits are now lamenting the lost possibility of Steam-like savings that Microsoft could have offered with its original, DRM-laden Xbox One, the fact remains that region free gaming is a proven way to save money on games.\n\nBut even more importantly than cost, having a region free console allows gamers to experience games that might not get an Australian release. Fans of JRPGs, for example, will be able to import games without needing a foreign console.\n\nAnd who can forget the frustrations of Rock Band lovers in the current generation who couldn't purchase the game's sequel in Australia without importing?\n\nThe good news also translates for non-Australians: this will also have the benefit of killing off the rumour that the Xbox One would only work in 21 countries around the world.\n\nIt's only a game\n\nIt's not all fireworks and champagne for international bargain hunters though. While Mattrick made it abundantly clear that Xbox One games will not have region locking, there has been no indication that the same rule will apply to Blu-ray discs or content available through the Xbox Live Marketplace.\n\nIn fact, given the similarities between the new terms and the Xbox 360's offering, it's unlikely the console will be completely region free.\n\nTo be fair, it's unlikely that Sony is looking at unlocking movie and PSN content across regions. But regardless of console manufacturer, it's still an arbitrary restriction for international gamers.\n\nBut perhaps we protest too much. The fact that the Xbox One and the PS4 are both games consoles, having region-free games is still a step in the right direction for Microsoft, and a much more palatable solution for gamers."}

Even though the book is problematic in many ways, the issues that it raises are more important than ever. Since its publication, the ecological crisis caused by global capitalism has only gotten worse. There are only so many resources to go around. Capitalism has created a system where people in the First World get more than their fair share at the expense of people in the Third World, and at the expense of the Earth itself. Capitalism has created a system that not only consigns the vast majority of humanity in the Third World to incredible poverty and oppression, but also a system that is unsustainable ecologically. I once attended a campaign rally many years ago, Elaine Brown, ex-Black Panther Party celebrity and then-current Green Party activist, informed her audience that she sought a system in which everyone, presumably both in the First and Third Worlds, could be millionaires. The proposition, like many idealist fantasies, was met with applause despite the obvious problems such a solution to the world's problems would entail. How would this super-mall economy of the nouveau riche materialize? Who would toil away to produce the goods? Who would staff the mall? The current system is unsustainable as it is, imagine how unsustainable it would be if First Worldist rhetoric were realized and every human being was somehow magically granted the leisurely, consumerist lifestyle, opportunities and way of life of the American nouveau riche. Even continuing as it has, civilization itself is headed for ecological catastrophe. Not only does capitalism steal the livelihood and dignity of the vast majority in the Third World, but it threatens the future of much of the life on Earth. The Earth weeps. The masses cry out for an alternative. The need for total revolution, for new socialism and Leading Light Communism, has never been greater. The need for Leading Light, the most advanced scientific leadership becomes greater every passing day. Shapiro's book convincingly shows that the past attempt at an alternative, at socialism, at reaching communism, in China was flawed in important ways. Shapiro shows that errors abounded in the Maoist revolution's approach to intellectual dissent, green science and to the natural world. According to Shapiro, despite its pseudo-scientific pretense, the Maoist ideal to control, to dominate, to micromanage, almost every aspect of the intellectual and natural world to better serve human interests often ended in disasters that worked against both the interests of humans and the environment. The revolution, says Shapiro, veered to unscientific extremes due to Maoist fanaticism:\n\n\"Our story begins not in the physical world but in the political one \u2014 with a struggle among human beings. In the summer of 1957, just a few years after the 1949 Communist victory, hundreds of thousands of China's most distinguished scholars and scientists were criticized, harshly punished, ostracized, and silenced in an 'Anti-rightist movement.' By destroying those who sought simply to perform the Chinese intellectual's traditional duty to speak out in order to assist the country's leaders to govern better. China deprived itself of authoritative voices that might have cautioned against foolhardy schemes that ultimately destroyed the natural environment. People from many levels of society contributed to the events that will be described in the coming pages. However, as we shall see, Mao played a leading role in launching the Anti-rightist movement, as he did in numerous subsequent decisions that affected China's environment for the worse.\" (Shapiro 21)\n\nShapiro does not hide her distaste for the Maoist regime. She often fails to distinguish between very different trends within the regime. She lets it be known that she is not a fellow traveler or sympathizer with the Maoist project. She has no love of Maoism or the Cultural Revolution. If Shapiro had to pick a side during the line struggles within the Communist Party in the last decade of Mao's life, Shapiro would opt for revisionism and capitalism, even Western liberalism. Even so, her criticisms can be a starting place for our own revolutionary self-criticism over errors that occurred in those years. The Maoist history is our own. Their victories are our own, so too are their defeats. It is our burden to provide answers to the masses, to ultimately explain why socialism in China was defeated. These errors, both the demand to micromanage dissent and the natural world, ultimately aided the counter-revolutionaries in China, and also in the Soviet Union. Rather than ignore the kinds of problems Shapiro raises, we should use her work as an opportunity to examine ourselves. We must dissect the past attempts at social transformation in"}

What was the secret to his success? Increasing the annual training volume of the contest lifts with his athletes in training. The Bulgarian training regime for weightlifters is legendary. Multiple sessions per day, six days per week with athletes working up to daily maxes in all their big lifts. The relatively small country of Bulgaria was outpacing the Soviet Union, which had a much larger population and the most advanced training based science on the planet at that time. Abadjiev demonstrated with clarity and certainty that attacking specificity with a volume based approach was the most dominant methodology for developing weightlifters.\n\nThere are many potential downsides to increasing volume, particularly when specificity is the only training means utilized. Many people will experience overuse injuries, become burned out psychologically, and demonstrate the classical signs and symptoms of overtraining syndrome. For the past few summer Olympic years, collegiate athletic training rooms were inundated with swimmers coming in with overuse shoulder injuries. Why? Because Michael Phelps' training regime would always be publicized, and collegiate swimmers would attempt to replicate the swimming volume that Phelps would accumulate in his training phases. Michael Phelps is able to handle the Michael Phelps training plan because he is Michael Phelps. He is anatomically well suited for swimming, his biomechanics are as on point as possible, and genetically he had a situation where he was able to buffer hydrogen with his energy systems better than almost any other human being on the planet. The greatest in the world are outliers, and the rest of us probably shouldn't attempt to try to copy everything that they do. The great ones won the genetic lottery. Their bony attachments are ideal for their sporting choice, and generally speaking their technical mastery is sounder than everyone else's.\n\nSo should we all give up hope and jump in the excuse heap? Absolutely not. If your sport biomechanics are really clean, you can handle larger training volumes compared with athletes who demonstrate suboptimal movement strategies. When speaking of overhead lifts, we as coaches and athletes need to analyze the anatomical considerations that are involved with the movement and maximize the strategies that will provide the most optimal biomechanics possible. Saying that any one particular bony region is the most critical segment of the body for an action is impossible.\n\n(Editor's note \u2013 The following section is very heavy in anatomy out of necessity. There is a series of videos demonstrating the techniques discussed below at the end of the post)\n\nThe positioning of one bony landmark is highly dependent upon its relative orientation to adjacent and even far off segments. That being said, scapular positioning and stability is of critical importance when discussing overhead lifts. In the competitive lifting and performance coaching communities, it is fairly well accepted that maximizing stability of the scapula is of critical importance. We focus on the local stabilizer muscles of the scapula, such as the lower trapezius and serratus anterior. We study the kinesiology text books that discuss the exact joint motions associated with what happens when either the insertion or the origin of one of these muscles fires. We then perform many repetitions of corrective exercises, such as wall slides and push-up plus to pick up the performance of these muscles. The problem with simply attacking these muscles with many of the exercise choices is that we fail to consider that air pressure driving out into the scapula from the regions of the lung that are adjacent to the posterior ribs that border the scapula is the mechanism of creating reflexive firing of the local stabilizing muscles. To see the way that traditional interventions have failed strength and power athletes, and approaches aimed at treating more proximal matters involving respiration and authentic stabilization mechanisms, here's a great example.\n\nLet me try to explain the way in which air pressure stabilizes the scapula first, and then I'll get into the critical zone of the lungs that must experience filling in order to pull off reflexive scapular stabilization. Many of us have seen someone squat who demonstrate knee valgus during the execution of the movement. What do we do to correct this? Put a band around their knees. The band would create a pull force that would be trying to cave the athlete's knees into the valgus position. When the band tries to force the athlete into valgus, the athlete reflexively pushes the knees out by recruiting the femoral abductor muscles. This strategy was developed by Gray Cook and is part of something that he calls, Reflexive Neuromuscular Training (RNT). If you push someone in a direction, they reflexively push back on you. The phenomenon that I am describing here is an RNT-style concept. The only difference is that in the case of stabilizing the scapula with air pressure, we are doing it from the inside out. The scapula sits on the posterior rib cage. If the posterior rib"}

But did you know the meaning of the Italian lyrics? Time to analyse what that track has to offer.\n\nEven though Francesco Gabbani is the bookmaker's favourite with the best betting odds in recent years, chances are that a part of the audience might see his song Occidentali's Karma as a joke act. The reason for that reaction is understandable as the artist competes with an up-tempo pop song and is further accompanied by a dancing gorilla on stage. In this way the serious and deep society criticism which is the main theme of the lyrics can't be spotted as easily. Time to have a look at the English translation of Francesco's lyrics:\n\nTo be or ought to be The Hamlet-like doubt As contemporary as Neolithic man Intelligence is d\u00e9mod\u00e9 Easy answers\u2026 Useless dilemmas\u2026 Wanted: tales with a grand finale We hope (hope, yes!) Whatever happens, panta rhei And \"Singing in the Rain\"\n\nNirvana lessons There's Buddha in single line Yard time for everyone, their time of fame! (Allez!) The crowd chants a mantra Evolution is stumbling The naked ape is dancing Westerners' karma Westerners' karma [\u2026] Virtual humanity Sex appeal (Sex appeal) When life loses focus Men fall [\u2026]\n\nEurovision.tv\n\nThe song starts the line ,,to be or ought to be\"(Martin Heidegger) which in its message is similar to Shakespeare's ,,to be or not to be\". This famous sentence from Hamlet has already a very deep meaning. It reflects uncertainty whether yes or not Prince Hamlet wants to live any longer in the situation he finds himself in. Francesco Gabbani in this way addresses modern day society as the following lyrics prove.\n\nThe Neolithic Man is a person from the Neolithic Era (10,200-4,500 BC), a period of time which is over for a long period of time already. Francesco wants to point out that in terms of thinking we actually are not as far away from that era as we probably should be, a harsh criticism regarding our society. The next two lines continue there, adding that in our world people stop thinking and start searching for easy answers. A very simple form of processing which might be adressed by the comparison with the Neolithic man before.\n\nIn the following phrases the lyrics say that people always look for tales with positive outcomes and then naively hope and believe them to come true. This criticism can be related to many different area and showcast a very general problem: the lack of self-implication in the process of solving the issues in our society.\n\nAnother interesting quote is Heraclitus' ,,Panta rhei\" (engl. ,,everything flows\"), interpreted by Plato as ,,everything flows and nothing remains\". It again addresses the same fatalist way of thinking which only implies belief and hope instead of own action. Humans are simply accepting the situation and go on singing in the rain (may refer to Gene Kelly's song Singing in the rain with the following lyrics\n\n,,I'm singin' in the rain\n\nJust singin' in the rain,\n\nWhat a glorious feeling,\n\nAnd I'm happy again.\" )\n\nThen, Francesco talks about Nirvana Lessons. Nirvana, according to buddhism, is the state of happiness we achieve, once the cicle of repeated rebirth is over. Life is considered as the pain we all have to get through first before we can reach that Nirvana.\n\nIn the following, it is mentioned that the crowd chants a mantra, which can be any religious sentence that is meant to come true if it is repeated often enough. This also showcasts how naively our society thinks \u2013 an opinion does not become true only by being shared by many people.\n\nOne of the most interesting lines is the reference to evolution. According to the lyrics it is stumbling right now, which alludes to the fact that human beings can survive in our society even if they are not a good or adaptable version of their species. What remains are many dancing apes, instead of high evolved humans.\n\nOf course, some of the lyrics can also be interpreted in different ways, but the main message remains the same.\n\nAs a summary can be said that there are many messages packaged into the lyrics of this entry. After a deeper analyse, Occidentali's Karma can even be seen as one of the most meaningful songs of this year's Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nWhat do you think? Can Francesco Gabbani win in Kyiv? Do you appreciate the song more after getting to know the lyrics? Let us know on social media!\n\nSources: EBU\n\nAuthor: Matei Ruta\n\nReclame"}

Take it from the person who probably knows best. Here's UConn Associate Head Coach Chris Dailey from \"UConn '95: Birth of a Dynasty:\n\n\"We really focused on what we had. We didn't get caught up in what we didn't have. We focused on Geno & I as coaches. Our vision.\n\nStarting a program, building a program. Being apart of that foundation. Right from the beginning, we've always focused on 'here's what we have:'\n\nWe have good people.\n\nA toughness.\n\nPeople who know how to play basketball.\n\n& those players helped us recruit more talented players but still, with the same mindset.\"\n\nAt the time, it just seemed like common sense. Nothing too farfetched or overdramatic.\n\nFast forward to now, 999 wins later. Everyone wants to know the secret. Everyone wants into UConn's practice.\n\nEverybody (now that Stewie's gone) wants to play UConn since they can't simulate what playing them is like. Everybody wants a piece of the pie.\n\nBut, Geno has been and will always be the first to tell you, it's just basketball. UConn just does it better than anyone else, and it's not a special drill or special potion. It begins and ends (not really \u2014 there's a ton of help from CD that goes unseen) with the Geno Auriemma effect.\n\nBorn from Italian parents who emigrated to Norristown, Pennsylvania when he was seven-years-old, Auriemma is the embodiment of the oft-misplaced concept of the \"American Dream.\" Thankfully for basketball junkies like myself, the dream he chose to chase was his own.\n\nGiven his first opportunity to coach at St Joseph's University a year after graduating in 1978, Auriemma got to learn from one of the absolute best in Jim Foster, who is still coaching and currently serving as the head coach of the Chattanooga Mocs of the Southern Conference.\n\nIronically enough? His fellow assistant coach on that staff was none other than Notre Dame Head Coach Muffet McGraw. Talk about iron sharpening iron. It's no wonder they've all been successful. Imagine having your late night basketball junkie conversations consist of that caliber of IQ. I salivate just thinking about it.\n\nFollowing a two-year return to coaching his high school boys team, Auriemma joined the University of Virginia women's basketball coaching staff as an assistant for four seasons under the incomparable Debbie Ryan. Immediately, two legends in the game \u2014 Ryan remained the UVA coach until retiring following the 2010-11 season, opening the door for current Head Coach JoAnne Boyle (who coached my sister) \u2014 got to show Geno Auriemma the ropes.\n\nSo, as much as one might try and call it luck of the draw, something is revealing to me that this was more destiny. A calling, if you will.\n\nThe last interview of the bunch, Auriemma was up against a strong selection of female coaches ready to take the reins of the UConn program for themselves. One of those names? Chris Dailey. Lore shows that if Geno had turned down the position, she would've been the hire. Maybe this will kill the question about why CD never leaves. She's where she wanted to be all along.\n\nRemember the vision from before? Well, please bear in mind: This was literally, just a vision.\n\n\"Anything that remotely would describe what you would need to recruit good players to come to Connecticut? None of that was here.\n\nThere was no 'hey, come play at Connecticut.\n\nHey, come play in our conference.\n\nHey, come play in our building. Come to this school & get a great education.\n\nHey! Come live in this beautiful, vibrant college community.'\n\nNo. 'Hey! Come stay in our world-class dorms.'\n\nNo. There wasn't one tangible thing that you could put your finger on & say 'this is why you should come to Connecticut.\"\n\nWife Kathy even goes on to say, confidently, that she never imagined staying at UConn, and never got an inkling of such from Geno early on either. He was even quoted as saying he would \"do three or four years here then move on to a real school that takes women's basketball seriously.\"\n\nWell, that all"}

The meeting was well attended, with 135 present, including workers and young people from South Africa, Greece, Italy, France, Ireland, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Pakistan, Libya and Bangladesh. North's presentation had a powerful impact, with dozens seeking continued contact with the Socialist Equality Party in Britain and a number applying to join.\n\nThe audience listened attentively to North's extensive lecture. It began with an outline of the theoretical and philosophical foundations of the WSWS\u2014rooted in the historical materialist tradition established by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.\n\nNorth gave an explanation of the present political situation, which centred on a comparison between the 15 years of the WSWS, 1998-2013, with the the equivalent period 100 years ago, 1898-1913. The earlier period led to the outbreak of World War I in 1914 and the subsequent revolutionary overthrow of Tsarism in Russia in 1917, in which the world's first workers' state was established by Lenin, Trotsky and the Bolsheviks.\n\nThe historic parallels drawn included a survey of the depth of the present economic crisis, the return to colonial-style wars, led by the United States, and the growing danger of war against Iran in the Middle East and against China.\n\nNorth noted the sharp ideological separation of the classical Marxist tradition represented by the International Committee of the Fourth International and the WSWS from the various petty bourgeois tendencies that now stood openly as pro-capitalist and pro-war.\n\nThe report was followed by wide-ranging questions from the audience. Among many questions asked, Neil, a philosophy student, noted how the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) movement had adopted right-wing, pro-war positions. He asked North, \"How do we within these various identities move our fellows into a different position, a Marxist position?\"\n\nNorth said that Marxism could not be utilised to render more correct an orientation based upon identity politics. He explained that identity politics is deeply rooted in postmodernism's repudiation of both the Enlightenment conception of a unified humanity and of Marxism, which is based upon class politics.\n\nAll discrimination based on a person's sexual orientation must be opposed, North said. \"This shouldn't be an issue with thoughtful people who are concerned with democratic rights.\" But a political perspective that declares sexual identity and race to be the primary social categories is invariably an attack on class-based politics and a striving instead for \"the allocation of privileges amongst various select identities.\"\n\nAmjad from Glasgow spoke about the \"incompetence\" of the trade unions and their inability to \"build a meaningful resistance to austerity.\" He asked, \"Do we need to build new trade unions? How do we organise the working class?\"\n\nAmjad referred to what he called \"the Venezuela experiment,\" asking how the SEP saw the future of Venezuela after the death of President Hugo Chavez.\n\nNorth explained that underlying the breakdown of the trade unions internationally \"is the globalisation of capitalist production and the international mobility of capital.\"\n\nThe national programmes of the trade unions were \"blown apart by globalisation\u2026 There is an objective basis for the crisis of trade unionism, and the rottenness of the bureaucracies is only a subjective expression of that deeper objective problem.\"\n\nIn a broader historical perspective, he added, \"trade unions at best can only be defensive organisations of the working class, and the problem of social revolution cannot be resolved by organisations whose aim is to fix the best possible conditions for the sale of labour power.\"\n\nThe existing trade unions have long ago given up even that function. However, \"The task before us is not the formation of new trade unions, but the creation of insurgent organisations of the working class, of a democratic character, revolutionary in their orientation, such as factory councils, rank and file committees. Such a struggle can only bear fruit by building a revolutionary movement in the working class.\n\n\"What separates the International Committee from other groups is that we do not conceive of the workers' movement in a trade union form. The central problem of the working class is politics, the struggle for power, the reorganisation of the productive forces of mankind. That is the central question.\"\n\nTurning to Venezuela, North asked, \"How long do we have to go on debating this? Looking for another leader, whether his name is Castro or Chavez or, at one time, Nasser in Egypt, Ben Bella in Algeria? Looking for one or another hero based on a largely bourgeois movement that shall grant reforms we can call socialism?\"\n\n\"The question again is the independent organisation of the"}

Just bung it all in the slow cooker, mix it up, set for 8 hours, and leave it overnight!\n\nThe details of how to slow cook came from The Pink Whisk, with additional ingredients from the veg mincemeat I made last last year, plus whatever Soph had left over :)\n\nSo here's what went in it:\n\n150g light suet\n\n200g suet\n\n400g (aka 2) cooking apples, cored, peeled and diced\n\n140g candied peel\n\n200g raisins\n\n200g currants\n\n200g sultanas\n\n200g cranberries\n\n80g chopped apricots\n\n100g chopped crystallised ginger\n\n250g chopped walnuts and dates mixed\n\n150ml ruby port\n\n60ml Calvados\n\n2tbsp honey\n\n1 tsp ginger\n\n1 tsp cinnamon\n\n1 tsp ground nutmeg\n\n1/2 tsp gournd cloves\n\n100g soft light brown sugar\n\n1 orange, zest and juice\n\n1 lemon, zest and juice\n\nThe only reason for 150g of light suet in there is that we had some lying around. We've discovered it contains palm oil, which we're avoiding for ethical reasons, so from now on it's full-fat suet (not that the light stuff saved many calories anyway).\n\nAnyway as I said\u2026 throw it all in the slow cooker, big mix with a big wooden spoon.\n\nThen on for 8 hours on low, then warm until we wake up and deal with it.\n\nNext morning it's all gone lovely and dark!\n\nAfter cooling I took the top off an it smelled amazing!\n\nThen it gets a good stir. Ah. Now we hit a problem\u2026 the back left side (which looks dark in the above pic if you look carefully) is actually burnt rock solid :(\n\nThe burnt part is, unsurprisingly, very bitter and not very nice at all. Thankfully the rest of it tastes great :)\n\nNow it's time to put it in jars. These need sterilising first, and as we don't have a dishwasher that means washing in soapy water followed by 5 minutes in a 160c fan oven.\n\nI managed to get 3 full jars out of it.\n\nUnfortunately there was another jar's worth stuck to the pot :(\n\nSo the pot is now soaking\u2026 and I'm off to the pub! I'm not sure if I just cooked for too long, kept warm for too long, or if the back left part of my slow cooker is hotter than other parts\u2026\n\nTomorrow I'm planning Tex-Mex chicken in the slow cooker, so I'll keep an eye out for hot spots."}

The minimum wage in Massachusetts last increased to $8 an hour in January 2008.\n\nIn the shadow of a looming 2014 ballot question on the minimum wage, the Senate also voted 31-7 to increase the wage for tipped employees to half the minimum wage. The tipped wage is currently $2.63 per hour.\n\nOne supporter, Sen. Mark C. Montigny, a New Bedford Democrat, said the bill might help close the growing gap between the rich and poor.\n\n\"Tens of thousands of people are working full time and living below the poverty level,\" Montigny said. \"It is inexcusable.\"\n\nThe bill now moves to the state House of Representatives, which is unlikely to vote on a minimum wage bill until sometime next year.\n\nThe bill for the first time would index the state's minimum wage to inflation. Starting in 2016, the minimum wage would rise each year at the same rate as the consumer price index for the Northeast.\n\nSupporters have said the increase is needed because some companies are making strong profits, but lower wage workers are falling behind.\n\nOpponents, including some business leaders, said that an increase would hike costs for businesses and could prompt layoffs.\n\nJon B. Hurst, president of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts, said the association strongly opposed the Senate bill. Hurst said the bill goes too far in giving Massachusetts the highest minimum wage in the country.\n\nHurst said the bill would increase costs for employers, make employers less competitive and eliminate some jobs including those held by teenagers.\n\n\"We've got to be somewhat in line with what competitors are doing,\" said Hurst.\n\nRhode Island increased its minimum wage to $8 starting Jan. 1, while Connecticut and New York are raising their wages to $9 on Jan. 1, 2015, and Dec. 31, 2015, respectively.\n\nStates cannot approve a minimum wage that is lower than the federal standard, currently $7.25 per hour, but they can approve a higher one. Washington state has the highest state minimum wage at $9.19; followed by Oregon, $8.95, and Vermont, $8.60.\n\nAccording to California's new law, the state minimum wage would increase from $8 an hour to $9 an hour on July 1, 2014, and then increase to $10 an hour on Jan. 1 2016.\n\nApproval of the bill comes as advocates said they have collected enough signatures to place a statewide question on the ballot next year to bring the minimum wage to $10.50 in January 2016. Tipped wages would climb to 60 percent of the minimum wage under the ballot question.\n\nAccording to a study by the nonpartisan Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center in Boston, 17,800 workers in Springfield would be affected if the minimum wage goes to $10.50 an hour, with 14,600 workers currently receiving less than $10.50 an hour and 3,200 earning just above that.\n\nStatewide, if the wage rises to $10.50, 495,000 workers would be affected, including 440,000 because they earn less than that."}
{"id": 259800, "ended": true, "length": 715, "text": "It is not known how many people are in this situation in Wellington with estimates ranging from 50 to 200, but the issue of homelessness is more complex and a much wider community problem than is generally understood.\n\nThe NZ Department of Statistics has a definition of homelessness which reflects this complexity: 'Homelessness is defined as living situations where people with no other options to acquire safe and secure housing: are without shelter, in temporary accommodation, sharing accommodation with a household or living in uninhabitable housing.'\n\nIn New Zealand there are a number of different situations people find themselves in, which can be defined as 'homeless'.\n\nPeople who are sleeping out on the streets are clearly homeless. People who have no security in their housing \u2013 such as those staying night by night at a shelter or backpackers \u2013 are also homeless. People in this situation have no security of tenure in the same way you would if you were flatting and held a tenancy. This lack of security also applies to people who live in boarding houses.\n\nPeople living in unsuitable housing are also considered to be homeless. Living in a garage or sleep-out without electricity or water would fall into this category. If someone has no fixed address, but is 'couch-surfing' or moving between friends or family members, they also come under the New Zealand definition of homelessness.\n\nIt is important to consider the factors behind such homelessness. Many people who experience homelessness in New Zealand have multiple issues and complex needs that have contributed to their homelessness. They may have experienced violence and abuse as a young person or be disconnected from family for other reasons, they may have unmet mental health needs or drug and alcohol addictions, they may have limited education and have been unemployed for extended periods, they may have spent time in prison.\n\nThere is often a misconception that people choose to be homeless and that it represents some kind of freedom. In our experience most people we talk with, express a strong desire to be living in their own home.\n\nWhat are the barriers to achieving housing for all in Wellington?\n\nThe main barrier is limitations around the availability of social housing. The Wellington City Council and Housing New Zealand provide accommodation and there are some supported accommodation options, but demand outstrips availability at present. We would like to see a wider range of housing options available which would include transitional, specialist accommodation tailored to the needs of the individual.\n\nHaving appropriate accommodation is a basic human right but some people require further support to maintain a tenancy. There are skills involved with maintaining a tenancy, and a set of rules to negotiate that can be challenging for some people. If you have limited literacy skills, reading and understanding a tenancy agreement can be difficult. Many people who experience homelessness have complex needs \u2013 physical or mental health needs, or addictions \u2013 and they also may need good support with these health issues to be able to keep a flat.\n\nBeing homeless can isolate people from Whanau and the wider community while creating a dependence on being part of a homeless or 'streetie' community. Being part of a 'streetie' community can be a barrier to moving out of homelessness.\n\nThe Soup Kitchen is often the first point of contact with an agency for someone experiencing homelessness. Our historical place in the Wellington community is as an entry point to access a safe community to have some basic needs of food and clothing met. At the Soup Kitchen, we provide people with an opportunity to engage with other agencies, for example around accessing health services and housing support."}

Justin Amash (R-Mich.) said in a statement. \"Most representatives are probably unaware they even voted on this legislation. It's the worst anti-privacy law since the USA PATRIOT Act, and we should repeal it as soon as possible.\"\n\nAmash introduced the repeal bill along with Reps.

Those incidents, he said, were possible because the people in charge of managing the cyber networks failed to use best practices on cybersecurity.\n\nAnd with the current components of the bill, Polis said, information would be shared with agencies such as the NSA and DHS who \"time and time again\" have broken privacy rules and overstepped legal authorities. \"I have no reason to believe they will abide by the privacy protections of this bill either,\" he said.\n\nPolis said he expects there to be support for the bill to repeal this legislation, but it may not pass as a piece of standalone legislation.\n\n\"It might take the form of appropriation amendments or other vehicles that are available for us,\" he predicted."}

It chases after a randomly chosen player, designated by a laser pointer on its underside. The Griller will relentlessly pursue the player the tracking laser is pointed at. It is frequently accompanied by Smallfry swarms.\n\nIn order to destroy a Griller, players must first hit its exposed tail back to stun it, then attack the spinning tails which appear while it is stunned. Anywhere else, and the armored vehicle takes no damage. A player will be instantly splatted upon running into its ink. A Griller is fast and can be unpredictable, so players have to be careful and wary of both the boss as well as its Smallfry escorts.\n\nGrillers only show up in certain special wave. If Mr. Grizz talks about Grillers in the dialogue box instead of Boss Salmonids, that means the players are in the special wave. This wave consists of only Grillers and groups of Smallfry. Grillers show up one at a time at the beginning, but later on in the wave they show up in pairs of two. Mr. Grizz will warn the players when the Grillers start spawning in pairs.\n\nIn-Game Information\n\nWhat Happens\n\nArmored vehicles called Grillers spawn one after another. Grillers lock their sights on to a target and will pursue it relentlessly.\n\nSmallfry are known for hitching a ride on the Griller and interfering with its targeting.\n\nHow to Get Golden Eggs\n\nAttack the weak spot on the back of the Griller to stun it.\n\nStunning Grillers will reveal further weak points. Attacking these weak points is the key to taking down Grillers and getting Golden Eggs.\n\nUsing a Sting Ray special, you can aim at the Griller and splat it without having to hit the tail.\n\nAdvice from Mr. Grizz\n\nIf the Griller has you in its sights, you're better off running away and letting your friends handle it.\n\nSupplementary Information\n\nOperating costs for a single Griller would be enough to deploy 100 regular Salmonid fighters.\n\nTrivia\n\nA Griller has 2200 HP, and dealing 400 damage to its tail will stun it for 5 seconds. For reference, a Cohock has 400 HP.\n\nObjects resembling tomato, corn, cucumber or zucchini, and pink Chum-sized Salmonid can be seen inside the Griller when zoomed in.\n\nGrillers can only travel on flat surfaces or smooth ramps, and cannot move up or down ledges without making a detour.\n\nGrillers cannot land on a propeller platform (such as the lifts in Marooner's Bay and the horizontal platforms in Salmonid Smokeyard). If a targeted player enters a propeller platform, Grillers will either instantaneously target another active player not on said platform, or linger in place with laser sights off, not targeting anyone (if all active players are on a propeller platform). Steel Eels behave in a similar way.\n\nGrillers are very similar to Flooders from the Octarian army. They distinguish themselves from Flooders in two ways. Grillers can be destroyed while Flooders cannot, and you can ride on a Flooder but not on a Griller.\n\nTips\n\nSince a Griller cannot step on or off ledges like players do, the targeted player should maneuver around walls and ledges to manipulate its path and the direction it is facing, taking care not to lead the Griller in the path of other players, so that the rest of the crew can attack its tail.\n\nPlayers may stay on a propeller platform to get themselves off Grillers' sights in a pinch, such as to heal or to run out the clock. Doing so will cause Grillers to target the rest of the crew not on such platform immediately, putting them at risk. Smallfry have no problem following players on a propeller platform, so make sure to eliminate them.\n\nIt is advised to activate the Sting Ray when two Grillers line up in front of the Sting Ray holder, as doing so will penetrate and stun both of them.\n\nBomb Launcher can be used on a stunned Griller to damage it further.\n\nWhile staying on a wall when targeted may help the rest of the crew aim at its tail, beware that Smallfry may jump up and splat any player clinging on a wall for too long.\n\nGallery\n\nVegetables seen inside a Gr"}

{"id": 259809, "ended": true, "length": 326, "text": "OBJECTIVE:\n\nThree groups of girls who were sexually abused (by either brothers, fathers, or stepfathers) were compared. The purpose was to identify the differing characteristics of the abuse, the family environments, and the psychosocial distress of these children.\n\nMETHOD:\n\nSeventy-two girls aged between 5 and 16 were assigned to one of the three groups. Subjects were matched between groups on the basis of their actual age. Children completed measures of traumatic stress; their mothers completed the Child Behavior Checklist-Parent Report Form (CBCL) and other self-report questionnaires on family characteristics. Workers in child protective services completed information regarding the nature and severity of the abuse.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nResults suggested few differences in the characteristics of sexual abuse between the three groups. However, penetration was much more frequent in the sibling incest group (70.8%) than in the stepfather incest (27.3%) or father incest (34.8%) groups. Ninety percent of the victims of fathers and brothers manifested clinically-significant distress on at least one measure, whereas 63.6% of stepfather victims did. Compared with father and stepfather perpetrators, brothers were raised in families with more children and more alcohol abuse.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nThe authors conclude that the characteristics of brother-sister incest and its associated psychosocial distress did not differ from the characteristics of father-daughter incest These findings suggest that theoretical models and clinical practices should be adjusted accordingly and that sibling incest should not necessarily be construed as less severe or harmful than father-daughter incest."}

Eva Tiamat Medusa, formally known as Richard Hernandez, grew up in Texas US, believing he was a woman trapped in a man's body and slowly started his transformation from a man to a woman and eventually into a \"human dragon\".\n\nOn her blog titled 'Eva Medusa Tiamat, Transspecieism \u2013 Metamorphosis', Tiamat writes: \"I am the Dragon Lady, A pre-op M2F transgender in the process of morphing into a human dragon, becoming a reptoid as I shed my human skin and my physical appearance and my life as a whole leaving my humanness behind and embracing my most natural self awareness as a mythical beast.\"\n\nAfter undergoing several persona changes, Tiamat settled for a dragon and underwent procedures, like nose modification, tooth extraction, ear removal, and eye colouring in the hope of looking more like a dragon. She is almost unrecognisable from what she looked like in 1990 before going through procedures, like her full-face tattoo.\n\nTiamat who lives in New Mexico derived her name from a video gamedragon, has gone as far as getting a forked tongue, horns implanted onto her forehead and the whites inside her eyes stained green. She recently underwent another operation, which involved cutting back both of her ears.\n\nTiamet is 95% covered in snake scale tattoos and prefers to be referred to as \"it\" rather than he or she. \"From the time I began my transformation journey, I have told people to not judge this book by its cover, but then again why not? I think this book cover is beautiful,\" wrote Tiamet next to her photo on Facebook."}

And because of their upbringings, there's \"this type of woodenness that Pete Campbell has that I also bring to Darcy.\"\n\nPhoto\n\nBut when it was suggested that neither are well liked, he was quick to take exception. \"The thing we have to realize about Darcy is that he's unpopular in a foreign world,\" he said. \"In his own world, Pemberley, he's very popular.\"\n\nHe himself is very unlike Darcy, he said, especially in the character's belief in his own sense of authority. Mr. Kartheiser said he was eager for notes and pointers from his cast mates. \"I'm not that good of an actor,\" he continued, \"so I kind of like say: 'Yeah? How do I fix it? Was it that bad? O.K. let me try again.' \"\n\nLow-key and soft-spoken, he mixed actorly pronouncements (\"there's a real nurturing environment here\") and a courtly speaking manner (\"the blessed role of Pete Campbell\") with sparing references to his personal life (his fianc\u00e9e is Alexis Bledel, a guest star on \"Mad Men\") and self-deprecating asides.\n\nUnsure whether he could pull off Darcy, he said that every night backstage he's thinking: \"Is this actually happening again? Didn't we just do this seven times last week?\" But if the prospect of appearing before 1,100 people a night is nerve-racking, that's part of the point.\n\nThis Minnesota-born actor grew up in theater here \u2014 his family is still in nearby Apple Valley \u2014 but between the ages of 15 and 25, he concentrated exclusively on television and film (landing leads in \"Masterminds\" and \"Another Day in Paradise\" and a recurring part in the series \"Angel,\" among other credits).

He also logged significant time at Children's Theater Company, a venerable Minneapolis institution, performing in, by his count, 18 main-stage shows and 3 national tours.\n\nAmong the performers he got to work with (and study) during that time was Sally Wingert, now the imperious Lady Catherine de Bourgh and the kindly Mrs. Gardiner in \"Pride and Prejudice.\"\n\nPhoto\n\n\"My favorite kid actors are less miniature adults than great, pleasant, open kids, and that was Vinny \u2014 sort of a fella, just a guy,\" she said by phone, adding that children don't get cast multiple times at the Guthrie if they're not good.\n\nMr. Kartheiser also stood out then for another reason. \"As a little boy, he had a very rough little sandpaper voice,\" she said, launching into an imitation that sounded a lot like one of Marge Simpson"}

Escuela Caribe is located in the Dominican Republic, one of the most impoverished areas of the world. \"And I found out about the school because you tend to notice other Americans there.\"\n\nWhen she first heard of the program, it sounded great.\n\n\"They told me the school was a place for kids that would either end up in jail, on the streets or dead, kids that were really in trouble,\" Logan said, \"And I thought to myself, what a great program, where kids can learn about another culture and get away from bad influences back home.\"\n\nA few years later, Logan was in film school and thought, \"Hey, that would be a good project, to go down and make a short, kind of heartwarming documentary about these rough-and-tumble kids learning about Dominican culture together and getting therapy.\"\n\n\"I had no idea what the school was really like or what their history was,\" she said.\n\nBut as she began to do research, to film and meet with former graduates of the program, she said, \"Slowly the story kind of unravelled about what was really going on at the school and all its dark past and what was still going on at the time.\"\n\nStudents at the small school are consigned to life in a rigidly codified set of levels. As former student Deirdre Sugiuchi told Raw Story on Friday, \"When you start at zero level, you then had rules about who you could look at. You couldn't talk to members of the opposite sex until you were on second level and you had to fulfill a wide variety of requirements to move up.\"\n\n\"At zero level, you'd have to be three feet away from a staff member or a supervisor at all times. You had to ask to go from room to room. It was insane,\" she said. \"Prisoners actually have more freedom than we had.\"\n\nFormer students told tales of being prey to every sadistic whim of their superiors, of beatings and punishing exercise regimes, as well as endless work projects that the students were never compensated for.\n\n\"All of their stories were so similar,\" said Logan, \"that it was clear this wasn't just one person exaggerating or one incident that happened one time. The abuses were systematic.\"\n\nThe school's program, she said, hasn't changed, in spite of the fact that it shut down and reopened under a new name, Crosswinds. Crosswinds still works from same charter it used to and maintains the strict level segregation between students.\n\nBelieving that she was still making a pro-Escuela Caribe film, the school staff gave her full access for student interviews. Very quickly, Logan said, she began to see signs that all at the school was not as administrators promised.\n\n\"There were just a lot of things that were very obviously wrong right away,\" she said.\n\nTwo students spoke particularly honestly to the documentary team: 17-year-old David, sent to Escuela Caribe because his parents thought he was gay, and 16-year-old Tai, who was African-American and outspoken, the latter trait landing her in frequent trouble at the school.\n\n\"We got really lucky with David and Tai,\" Logan said. \"Because David had only been there four or five weeks, so he wasn't completely terrified yet of the insanity there. He still had hope, I guess?\"\n\n\"Right away it was apparent that this kid should never have been accepted to any type of reform program in the first place,\" she said. \"He was a 4.0 student and he was upset that he couldn't talk to his parents. He was worried what his boss at the store in the mall he worked at was going to think. His concerns were that of a good kid.\"\n\n\"Another student was Tai,\" Logan said. \"She would just say what was on her mind and get in trouble for it. She was, like, 'You can have my body, but you can't have my soul.'\"\n\nThe plight of the kids there was so horrifying that ultimately Logan lost faith not just in New Horizons and Escuela Caribe, but in all of Christianity.

{"id": 259820, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump fact-check each other better than journalists, according to CNN's Jeffrey Lord. (Getty Images, Reuters)\n\nJeffrey Lord loves Donald Trump. The former Ronald Reagan aide's job at CNN is to analyze the presidential race through a pro-Trump lens, and he does it with unparalleled dedication. While another of the cable channel's in-house Trump backers, Kayleigh McEnany, recently refused to defend the presumptive Republican presidential nominee's attack on a federal judge \u2014 condemned as racist by House Speaker Paul Ryan and others \u2014 Lord contended that his candidate was actually calling out racism.\n\nKnow what Lord doesn't love? Fact-checkers. And if you thought his argument in support of Trump's tirade against a \"Mexican\" judge (who is actually from Indiana) was convoluted, get ready for Lord's case against fact-checking. He presented it Sunday on CNN's \"Reliable Sources.\"\n\nI think the best fact-checkers in a presidential campaign are the opponents, in this case Hillary and Donald Trump. I think they do a better job of countering the assumptions of the other candidate than fact-checkers. I mean, I hate to be the dissenter here, and I'm not saying this because of Donald Trump, but I honestly don't think this fact-checking business \u2014 as we're all into this \u2014 is anything more than, you know, one more sort of out-of-touch, elitist, media-type thing. I don't think people out here in America care. What they care about are what the candidates say.\n\nLet's just note right off the bat that Merriam-Webster's definition of \"journalism\" reads, in part, \"writing characterized by a direct presentation of facts.\" Reporting facts is literally the definition of journalism.\n\nThe first principle of the Society of Professional Journalists' code of ethics is \"seek truth and report it.\" Again, seeking the truth \u2014 the facts \u2014 is Job No. 1 for journalists. Lord says doing this job is \"elitist\" and seems to suggest (or at least imply) that reporters ought to be nothing more than stenographers, relaying \"what the candidates say,\" since that's what voters care about.\n\nIt's not that facts don't matter at all, according to Lord. It's just that \"the best fact-checkers in a presidential campaign are the opponents.\" Apparently journalists ought to let Trump and Hillary Clinton police themselves and just chronicle the back and forth.\n\nLord is right about this much: Americans hold a pretty dim view of the press. Trust in the media is at a historic low \u2014 just 40 percent, according to Gallup. Based on that sorry statistic, we can conclude that many voters doubt whether fact checks really contain facts.\n\nBut we also know voters don't put much trust in Trump and Clinton, either. Fox News regularly polls voters on whether they trust both candidates. For Trump, the average trust level in the last three surveys was 38 percent; for Clinton, it was 34 percent.\n\nThese are the people who should be responsible for fact-checking each other?\n\nWe need not guess how Trump and Clinton would perform as fact-checkers; their campaigns are already in the fact-checking business, and the results aren't always great.\n\nOn Friday, Trump delivered a speech in which he ripped Clinton. His campaign followed up by distributing a 35-page document to reporters that contained the \"top 50 facts about Hillary Clinton\" from the address, including one he repeats often on the trail: \"Fact 19: Clinton was at home sleeping while attacks in Benghazi continued.\"\n\nThe first supporting source on this \"fact\" was ... Donald Trump. Yes, Trump checks his facts with himself. The second source was a FactCheck.org piece which, it turns out, concluded there is \"no evidence\" for Trump's claim.\n\nTo review, Trump cited himself and a report that refuted his statement. He seems not to understand how this works.\n\nClinton's team fired back with its own fact check: \"15 biggest lies in Trump's speech.\" The charge that Clinton slept through the Benghazi attacks made the list. But instead of denying Trump's claim directly, Clinton simply referred to the same FactCheck.org story.\n\nThen there was this:\n\nLIE: \"Hillary's Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans out of work.\" FACT CHECK: Comprehensive immigration reform would boost economic growth and increase the size of the labor force.\n\nWell then, I guess that settles it. Or not. The Clinton campaign linked to a report prepared by advisers to President Obama \u2014 a useful reference but hardly the kind of independent research that would end a debate.\n\nThere is little doubt that journalistic fact-checking efforts are viewed skeptically by many voters. Referees in sports aren't very popular, either. But Trump and Clinton have clearly demonstrated that they"}

{"id": 259824, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "As you may know, I enjoy trying to predict the future for ballplayers . So, when A-Rod got his 3000 th hit, a thought crossed my mind: could I apply my framework for predicting future Hall of Famers to milestones like 3000 hits? This is the result.\nWhat I did was as follows: first, I went through the 29 players with 3000 hits and checked where they all stood hit-wise at each age. Then, I looked at the median mark for the group, and checked how many ballplayers in history had reached that number of hits by the same age. Then, I took a straight percentage of how many of the total number of players at that mark actually wound up over 3000 hits.\nFor an example, say that the 15 th most hits at age 20 among 3000-hit players was 100. I then looked at how many players in history had 100 hits through their age 20 season, and figured out the percentage of that number that went on to 3000 hits. After that, just to get another benchmark, I repeated the process with the lowest hit total in the 3000 hit club by age (and second lowest, since many of the lowest marks were by Cap Anson , who played in such a radically different time that I wasn't sure how useful of a marker he'd be for other players).\nWith the percentage of players at each milestone that went on to 3000 hits, I then looked towards the game today, checking the leaders of each age bracket today against the historical marks.\n23: Median-467 Hits (14.02% at this point make it to 3000)\nSecond Lowest- 80 Hits\nI'm going to include everyone younger than 23 here, since there are so many good young stars in the game today. We only have one 23-year-old at this mark. Mike Trout , with 656 hits (all stats are as of the morning of 6/28) has already reached the median for next season, and should easily be halfway to the age 25 mark by the season's end. I don't have the specific numbers, but I figure being this far ahead of the curve has to give him a significant leg up on his chances of reaching 3000. \u00a0\nHowever, in addition to Trout, we have 22-year-olds Bryce Harper and Manny Machado . Neither has 467 hits yet, but both are over 400 (436 and 416, respectively), meaning that they should easily cruise by this mark an entire season early as well. No other 23-year-olds will reach this mark in 2015, but check back next season to see how Xander Bogaerts (22, 216 hits) is doing. 23-year-old runners-up include Christian Yelich (285) and Nick Castellanos (200), so they're technically still ahead of where Wade Boggs (who debuted relatively late) was as this point (which really says more about how impressive Wade Boggs was than their chances, to be honest).\n24: Median-584 (11.19%)\nNo players above the median here, although leaders Nolan Arenado (334), Yasiel Puig (320), and Marcell Ozuna are ahead of where some 3000 hit club members were at the same point (namely, Boggs, Lou Brock , Honus Wagner, and Craig Biggio ).\nFirst among this age group is Starlin Castro , with 923 hits so far. Assuming he's healthy, he might hit next year's 995 mark by the end of the season, although his drop off and the crop of rising Cubs stars might cut into his playing time. No one else is at 807 hits yet, but Freddie Freeman had a pretty good chance (732) before his DL-stint. Assuming he's not making it, our next best chances would be Jason Heyward (714) and Jose Altuve (711), although even if they make it, there's still not even a 1-in-5 chance at this stage. Next on the list is Giancarlo Stanton , but his injury and distance (693) makes it unlikely.\n26: Median-995 (20.27%)\nElvis Andrus leads the way, with 1027 hits (nearly double second place Mike Moustakas 's total of 516). But given his regression on offense the last few years, I'm not sure how many more seasons we can expect to see him above the 3000-hit median.\n27: Median-1175 (23.08%)\nJustin Upton might make it to 1175 by year's end (he's at 1116), but outside of him, no active 27-year-olds are even to 650 hits.\n28: Median-1327 (21.13%)\nFor the second time, we have no players above the cut-off. Andrew McCutchen leads 28-year-olds with 1063 hits and counting, which tops about a sixth of the 3000 hit club, but he's still"}

Many of which have powerful, sometimes magical, properties. This collection is an attempt to capture some of the most popular and widely recognized ores and materials and compile them all into one, easy-to-reference document. It is an attempt to create a bit of lore around each substance with ties and references to other existing lores and legends in the D&D world. Reference Table (Yet to be Filled In) Metal Description Value/Pound Value (Multiplier) Rarity (Weapon) Rarity (Armor) Rarity (Other) Adamantine One of the strongest metals in existence. 100gp x2 Uncommon Uncommon - Arjale A form of infernal ice found in the Nine Hells. 300gp x3 Rare Very Rare Rare, Legendary Blacksteel A matte black metal found in the Underdark. 100gp x2 Uncommon Uncommon Rare 1\n\nAdamantine Perhaps the most recognizeable material in fantasy lore, adamantine is commonly known as an incredibly tough and protective metal. Heavy yet sturdy, adamantine is colored anywhere between slate and deep red and is sought after by many adventurers who prefer to depend on trustworthy armor to protect them. Adamantine Armor Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon A suit of adamantine armor saves many lives, as any critical hit made its wearer is treated as a normal attack. Adamtine armor also cannot be destroyed by nonmagical means, and is borderline indestructible. Adamantine Weapon Weapon (any bludgeoning or piercing), uncommon Weapons made from adamtine deal one extra damage die of their weapon's damage type. Additionally, a weapon forged from adamantine cannot be destroyed by nonmagical means, such as rust or acid. Arjale (True Ice) Known scientifically as arjale and commonly as true ice or hell ice, this substance is a sort of combination of metal and literal ice. Arjale is found exclusively in the cold layers of the Nine Hells known as Stygia and Cania, making it exceedingly rare and valuable. This substance, although appearing slick and cold like ice, never melts and always retains its shape even when exposed to flame. To even touch true ice would immediately harm you from its sheer coldness, let alone be pierced by it, so spears and tridents of this material are commonly wielded by gelugons, or ice devils, and because of this the ore has gathered a reputation for the its lethality. For most humanoids, to wear amor made exclusively from this material would be suicide, as the wearer would die from cold very quickly. However, one exceptional smith whose name is lost to history once studded leather armor with hell ice and imbued it with additional fiend-smiting properties, and passed it on to a dwarvish warrior named Torria Stonefell who sought to cleanse the Nine Hells. Torria died somewhere in that plane, and legend says that her armor is kept somewhere by the Archdevil that fell her. Arjhale Armor Armor (medium or heavy, but not hide), very rare It would be foolish for most to waste materials to make such a suit of arjale armor as a creature that directly touches it takes 1 cold damage, and a creature that wears it is treated as if it is not proficient in the armor and takes 7 (2d6) cold damage at the beginning of its turns. If worn by a creature who is immune to cold, it functions as a +2 armor and the armor gains a Strength requirement of 15. Additionally, a creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the wearer or hits the wearer with a melee attack takes 3 (1d6) cold damage. Arjale Weapon Weapon (any melee weapon), rare, can be attuned Simply touching a weapon made from arjale deals 1 cold damage, and melee attacks with arjale weaons deal and extra 10 (3d6) cold damage on a hit. Additionally, if you are attuned to the weapon, it becomes magical for the purpose of overcoming resistances and immunities, and after landing a successful melee attack you can force the target to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, or for 1 minute the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet; it can take either an action or a bonus action on each of its turns, not both; and it can't take reactions. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature immune to cold damage is unaffected. This property can't be used again until the next dawn. Arjale Ring Ring, rare (requires attunement) While wearing this ring, you are resistant to cold damage and are naturally adapted to cold climates, as described in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide."}

The leftover material from this massive explosion then clumped together to form the planets, in a process called core accretion.\n\nA new study suggests Jupiter and Saturn likely took shape within the first 4 million years of the solar system's formation, which further supports the core accretion model, Benjamin Weiss, co-author of the study and professor of planetary sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), told Space.com. [Watch: Our Solar System Built to Scale in Nevada Desert]\n\nWeiss and lead author Huapei Wang, a postdoctoral student at MIT, studied the magnetic orientations of four ancient meteorites called angrites. Rare today, they fell to Earth at different times and were found in Brazil, Argentina, Antarctica and the Saharan desert. This type of space rock acts as a good marker for what the cosmic environment was like during the early days of the solar system.\n\n\"When the solar nebula was present, it generated a substantial magnetic field,\" which would in turn be recorded in meteorites formed during this time, Weiss said. However, he added, the researchers observed little to no remnant magnetization in the oldest of the four angrites, which formed 3.8 million years. That lack of magnetization suggests the gas and debris of the solar nebula had already dissipated by that time, Weiss said \u2014 and thus, that the solar system's large-scale structure, including Jupiter and Saturn, must have already been established.\n\n\"Solar systems form out of the condensation of a gaseous nebula. We obtained an accurate and precise age for the lifetime of our solar system's ancient [solar] nebula and the magnetic field,\" Weiss told Space.com. \"We found that the [solar] nebula and [magnetic] field had dispersed 3.8 million years after the formation of the solar system.\"\n\nThe study, published yesterday (Feb. 9) in the journal Science, offers a more precise estimate of the solar nebula's lifetime and will therefore help to determine when and how other planets formed in the solar system, the researchers said.\n\n\"Since the solar nebula lifetime critically affects the final positions of Jupiter and Saturn, it also affects the later formation of the Earth, our home, as well as the formation of other terrestrial planets,\" Wang said in a statement from MIT.\n\nGoing forward, the researchers said they plan to study other primitive asteroid samples to be collected by the Hayabusa 2 spacecraft and NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission, which are expected to return to Earth in the early 2020s.\n\n\"I plan to measure the magnetism of these returned materials, which may contain records of the [solar] nebula from times and locations around the sun different from what we have measured in meteorites,\" Weiss told Space.com.\n\nFollow Samantha Mathewson @Sam_Ashley13.

As well as concerns over North Korea's technological progress toward a nuclear-tipped missile that could strike the continental U.S., Trump is pushing for a narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea.\n\nSince his 2016 election campaign, Trump has been critical of a 2012 bilateral free trade agreement and barriers to U.S. auto exports. South Korea had trade surplus of $17 billion with the U.S. last year when including both goods and services.\n\n\"We are renegotiating a trade deal right now as we speak with South Korea and hopefully it will be an equitable deal, it will be a fair deal for both parties,\" Trump said alongside Moon in the Oval Office. \"\"We want something that will be very good for the American worker.\"\n\nAhead of Moon's visit, the White House official said Trump would call for the lifting of barriers to U.S. auto sales in South Korea and voice concern over steel exports from China that reach the U.S. via South Korea. South Korean companies on Thursday announced plans to import more American shale gas and build new factories in the U.S. that Seoul hoped could help fend off the criticism.\n\nMoon said he and Trump had \"honest discussions\" at dinner on the North Korean nuclear issue and other issues of mutual interest.\n\n\"It was a great opportunity for us to further the trust and friendship between me and President Trump,\" Moon said. \"It was also an opportunity for us to reconfirm the fact that the United States and Korea are walking together on the same path towards a great alliance.\"\n\nAfter expanded talks involving other officials, the two leaders will make statements to reporters.\n\nOn North Korea, Trump said, \"we have a very, very strong and solid plan.\" On Thursday, the Treasury Department blacklisted a Chinese bank accused of conducting millions in illicit business with North Korea as Washington intensified pressure on Beijing to crackdown on its wayward ally.\n\nThe South Korean leader has sought to make clear to the U.S. that he is also serious about dealing with his neighbor's threat, despite his inclination to restart dialogue with the North.\n\nMoon's conservative predecessor, who was impeached in a bribery scandal, took a hard line toward North Korea. In recent interviews, Moon has said sanctions alone cannot solve the problem of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, but the \"right conditions\" are needed for dialogue.\n\nIn another point of contention, Moon has delayed the full deployment of a U.S. missile defense system, which is intended to defend South Koreans and the 28,000 U.S. troops based in the country, pending an environmental review.\n\nBefore Friday's talks at the White House, Moon laid a wreath at the Korean War Memorial monument near the Washington Mall. He was accompanied by Vice President Mike Pence, whose father served in the U.S. Army during the 1950-53 Korean War. Under the pale blue morning sky, they observed a moment of silence as a lone trumpeter played \"Taps.\"\n\nIt was the second occasion during Moon's four-day visit that he has paid tribute to American veterans of that conflict. On Wednesday, he visited a memorial to Marines who fought in rearguard U.S. action in 1950 that enabled a mass evacuation of Korean civilians, including Moon's parents."}

Why did the ball drop? Why did the batter swing? What exactly happens to the ball as it is thrown? What happens to the ball depends on what spin was put on it. What causes the ball to curve, slide or stay in a strait pattern? This all has to do with the fact that there is drag force, or air resistance. A curve ball is created when a ball is spinning. The faster flowing air under the ball creates less pressure, which forces the ball to dive or break. Baseball would be a dull game without drag force because there would be no curves, sliders, or knuckle balls.\n\nImage Source\n\n\nImage Source\n\nTwisiting Motion of the wrist to cause a curve ball\n\nImage Source So how exactly do pitchers throw the curve balls? They grasp the ball with the middle and index fingers on or near the stitching, with their thumb underneath. As they throw the ball, they snap their wrist in a turning motion, like turning a door knob, to make the ball spin in the direction of the throw. The stitching on the ball gathers up air as the ball rotates, creating higher air pressure on one side of the ball. The higher velocity difference puts more stress on the air flowing around the bottom of the ball. That stress makes air flowing around the ball \"break away\" from the ball's surface sooner. Conversely, the air at the top of the spinning ball, subject to less stress due to the lower velocity difference and can \"hang onto\" the ball's surface longer before breaking away. Therefore curveballs do most of their curving in the last quarter of their trip. Perception plays a big role in the curve ball: The typical curveball goes through only 3.4 inches of deviation from a straight line drawn between the pitcher's hand and the catcher's glove. However, from the perspective of the pitcher and batter, the ball moves 14.4 inches. This proves that a curve ball really curves.\n\nImage Source"}

I didn't have a jigsaw but it would be really helpful in some places. -Installation kit i got was a little pricey for a block of plastic and a piece of metal but it was invaluable. kit works good with any old hammer. -underlay rolls are good for padding and moisture protection and doesn't raise the price a whole lot like the floors with underlay attached already. This was my first laminate installation and I did it like a pro and you can too.\n\nRated 4 out of 5 by Colten970 from Very happy with this flooring!!! First off all, I have never done laminate flooring so this was a learn as you go kind of thing. I would recommend watching some youtube videos, they help! The first 2 rows from the wall were the hardest to get started as nothing would line up. You learn that your walls are not perfectly straight! However, after you fight those first 2 rows everything goes super smooth and simple! ***Important*** As big of a waste of money those kits with the rubber bumper and pull bar seem, DO NOT SKIP OUT ON IT! You will destroy the planks if you try using anything else! trust me, I learned the hard way! Overall, I am very happy with the outcome! Today is day 5 after installation and its still beautiful! Its fairly durable, We have no scratches so far...\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by KamTX from Good floor, easy install, nice color, and really affordable. Saw this online and found a store that had quite a few boxes in stock local. First thing was I Read the instructions and install went really smooth. Planks Locked in place perfect (I wouldn't tap to hard when locking them in, just tap right until you see the gap close flush and no more) and I maybe had only 2 wood planks out of 18 boxes that were not usable. Its been a few months since I did the install, so far no problems. Has been holding up quite well.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by acsparkle from Stunning Flooring I recently upgraded my condo with this flooring. I hired a general contractor to install the flooring even though is says diy. Regardless the flooring is magnificent! Everybody that sees the place in person or via pictures says the flooring is amazing. I used a white trim as the shoe and in between the stairs. The quality of the laminate is awesome, don't let the price fool you. This is a great product.\n\nRated 1 out of 5 by Jbuck from Installation was easy really liked the look that is why we choose it.

The store claimed they had enought to do my 1200 square foot + first floor. Well they didnt it took several trips to get it all and a couple that they claimed that it had arrived but it hadnt. Then got first scatch before i was even done installing it. Thans to my 2 year old. Hasnt even been a year and my dogs and kids have scratched this floor all over way to easily. The have even manage to break chips out of it. Havent finshed paying for it and now i have to start figuring out how to replace it.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Averagehomeowner from Great product for the money!!!! I"}

As a part of Off Track's summer season we're bringing you the coolest of sounds for summer, and that means we're on our way out to search for water rats.\n\nWe meet on a cool morning in the affluent suburb of Mosman, where the only people out on the street are the cleaners arriving for work in big houses, and intrepid ecologists keen on a rat hunt.\n\nWe are on the lookout for the water rat, also known as the Rakali.\n\n'It's quite distinct, it's semi-aquatic so it spends a lot of its time in water, and it's filling the same niche as otters,' says Professor Peter Banks from the University of Sydney.\n\nIts scientific name is Hydromys chrysogaster, which refers to its golden belly fluff which you may be privileged to glimpse, if you ever get to see a specimen.\n\nThey are known to be elusive and shy, and it's lucky we've got any water rats at all in the Harbour.\n\nWhen the depression hit in the 1930s the water rat's water-repellent fur was used to substitute for a ban on imported furs.\n\nAnd back even further, in 1900 when the Bubonic Plague hit the shores of Sydney, a bounty was put on rats. We know that water rats were slaughtered, because one appears in a photo like a trophy laid out at the front of a pile of deceased rodents.\n\nBut these guys are the goodies, says Professor Banks, who is investigating whether the large rodents could be used to help control pest-rats.\n\n'Theory tells us that wherever you've got an intact biodiversity, it's going to be robust to invasive species. So if we can make and understand what makes for a robust native fauna, I think we can understand how we can control these [pest] rats.'"}

Following the evaluation process, the Commission will present its proposal on how to address the identified challenges in telecoms and broadband.\n\nWhat Internet connection will we need in the future, when many of our objects are connected to each other? Are we still going to use our fixed phones or only our mobile devices? What about apps which connect us to our family and friends over the Internet, do they need to respect the same rules as traditional telecoms operators, such as facilitating switching between services? How do we coordinate spectrum across the Union as radio waves know no border? - These are some of the questions of the two public consultations starting today.\n\nThe two consultations \u2013 one on Europeans' broadband needs and the other focusing on the review of the current telecoms framework - are open until 7 December 2015. Following the evaluation process, the Commission will present its proposal on how to address the identified challenges in telecoms and broadband. Creating the right conditions for digital products, networks and services to flourish is part of the Commission's Digital Single Market Strategy presented in May. Progress has already been made: earlier this year, EU institutions agreed on strong net neutrality rules protecting the right of every European to access Internet content without discrimination and on the end roaming charges by June 2017 (press release).\n\nAndrus Ansip, Vice-President for the Digital Single Market, said: \"The Internet is the oxygen of our digital economy and society. We are more and more connected, at every moment, everywhere. This means that access to high-speed and high-quality Internet has become essential to every European: people, companies, organisations or public bodies. We are asking you about your needs and your expectations regarding your Internet access in the European Union. We are also gathering views on the current telecoms rules and how they should evolve to support the Digital Single Market. Take this opportunity to have your say on Europe's digital future.\"\n\nG\u00fcnther H. Oettinger, Commissioner for the Digital Economy and Society, said: \"More than ever, Europe needs top-class connectivity. This will ultimately determine the success of the Digital Single Market. We therefore need rules that underpin sustainable, market-based, high-performance fixed and wireless broadband infrastructures for 2020 and beyond. And it is not just about the telecoms sector; every part of our economy and society has a vital stake in these issues. We therefore seek a broad and inclusive public debate, based on the best evidence of future needs.\"\n\nThe consultation on the review of the 2009 Telecoms Package will examine to what extent the EU's telecoms rulebook needs to be modernised to address technological and market challenges. It asks about the future of network access regulation, spectrum management, communication services, universal service and telecoms governance. It covers the evaluation of fundamental legislation including the 2002 Framework Directive, the Authorisation Directive, the Access Directive and the Universal Service Directive as modified in 2009 by the Better Regulation Directive and the Citizens' Rights Directive, as well as the BEREC Regulation.\n\nThe consultation on future Internet speed and quality needs asks what Europeans expect from their fixed and mobile networks beyond 2020. In particular which future products, applications and services will depend on connectivity and what will they require in terms of security, speed, quality, data downloads and uploads and ubiquitous connectivity. Views and inputs will help define technical requirements for future digital infrastructures. They will also influence the decisions related to funding under the European Structural & Investment Funds, the Connecting Europe Facility and the European Fund for Strategic Investment.\n\nThe two telecoms consultations are a major strand of the Commission's Digital Single Market Strategy to create the right conditions for digital products, networks and services to flourish. Earlier this year, the European Council and Parliament reached political agreement on Commission proposals for strong net neutrality rules protecting the right of every European to access Internet content without discrimination and to end roaming charges by June 2017 (IP/15/5265).

Mansour, a young Muslim man and Malka, who was born Jewish and converted to Islam, were surrounded by security guards as they arrived at the Shemesh Aduma (Red Sun) wedding hall. Outside, about 150 meters away from the entrance to the hall at the end of the street, some 200 right-wing protesters demonstrated against what they called \"assimilation in the Holy Land.\" A counter-demonstration was held by the entrance to the hall.\n\nEarlier in the day, the court refused to prohibit the protest outside the wedding hall where the mixed Muslim-Jewish celebrated their recent marriage, and ordered protesters to remain at least 200 meters from the venue, which is located in an area filled with supermarkets and other banquet halls.\n\nThe Rishon Letzion Magistrate's court issued the ruling after the couple applied for an injunction to stop the demonstration organized by Lehava (which is both a Hebrew word meaning \"flame\" and a Hebrew acronym for Preventing Assimilation in the Holy Land).\n\nEach guest at the wedding was asked by police to identify themselves and answer questions posed by police and security guards to prove they had been invited. The protesters attempted to come closer to the hall a number of times while cursing the couple, but the police moved them back to the area set aside for their protest, as per the court's instructions.\n\nThe protesters shouted racist and threatening slogans such as \"Death to leftists,\" and waved Israeli flags and blew the shofar. They carried signs saying such things as \"Daughter of Israel to the people of Israel,\" and \"Assimilation is a Holocaust.\"\n\nKeep updated: Sign up to our newsletter Email * Please enter a valid email address Sign up Please wait\u2026 Thank you for signing up.

Their signs said things such as \"Love for everyone,\" \"Only love will win\" and \"1,000 flames will not put out love.\" A few of the guests thanked them and honked their horns in support.\n\nA number of the right-wing protesters complained about being unable to approach the hall and swore at the guests and the counter protesters. Attorney Itamar Ben Gvir, a leading Kahanist who represented Lehava in court, said the court's decision to allow the demonstration near the hall was \"a victory for the freedom of speech. Only this morning they tried to prevent us from protesting and I am pleased the court accepted in practice our position and allowed freedom of expression. This is a democratic country,\" he said. \"I think we have the right to protest against assimilation. That is what we have come to do today,\" said Ben Gvir.\n\nThe couple lives in Jaffa and have already had a legal Muslim wedding; last night's event was only a celebration. The couple met five years ago and Morel converted to Islam. Mansour said that up until the past few days they had not experienced such blatant manifestations of racism. Malka said her mother, sisters and other relatives were slated to attend; her father, however, is opposed to her marriage to a Muslim and had declared that he would not attend the party.\n\nIn court yesterday, the representative of the police proposed holding the demonstration in a parking lot about 200 meters from the hall. Judge Iriya Mordechai ruled that the protesters must remain at least 200 meters from the building, even if they refuse the parking-lot space offered to them. She stressed that her ruling was aimed at preventing friction between the demonstrators and the guests at the event, which was held under heavy police guard.\n\n\"Regrettably, the respondents' actions to prevent the wedding, which have been carried out at a sensitive time for Jewish-Arab relations in any case, have borne rotten fruit and have stirred up a turbid wave of hatred and violence that will peak at a moment that is known and predictable, like its results,\" wrote attorney Yaniv Segev on Mansour's behalf in his request for the injunction. \"It is almost certain that the planned demonstration on the day of his wedding will spill over into violent areas.\"\n\nSegev called the judge's decision precedent-setting, saying it was the first time an Israeli court had approved the request of a private person to prevent a demonstration near a private event.\n\nGuy Ronen, one of those behind the demonstration in support of the couple, said he came to protest such gross invasion in private, personal matters. \"It is a wedding. The public arena must not interfere in it. The couple has the right to choose their love. They are not a public institution.\"\n\nPresident Reuven Rivlin commented"}

Though admitting that evolutionists do not know how life could have evolved from lifeless elements through naturalistic processes, Cosmos host Neil deGrasse Tyson assumes that it did. Then he weaves tales of how primordial life-forms could have found an ark of safety through Earth's presumed history of multiple catastrophic surface-destroying collisions.\n\n\"Must We Die?\"\n\n\"Must we die?\" asks Tyson as the episode opens. The opening words point to the motivation of Gilgamesh in the famous ancient Akkadian epic. Gilgamesh, the hero of the tale that includes one of the oldest flood legends to be written down, searches for immortality. But the question expresses a concern unique to human beings. We humans are aware that we will die, concerned about what will happen to us after we die, and interested in leaving some sort of legacy marking our significance to future generations. Some people blame God for the death and suffering that intrude upon our lives.\n\nBy understanding our true history we can understand the origin of suffering and death. God created a perfect world but warned Adam that disobedience would result in death. Man rebelled, and therefore we must die ( Romans 5:12\u201321 ) and face our Creator ( Hebrews 9:27\u201328 ). However, eternal life is given to everyone who repents and trusts in the sacrificial death of God's Son Jesus Christ ( John 3:16\u201318 ; John 3:36 ; Romans 3:23; 6:23 ).\n\nWith the written word we can preserve our thoughts and share them with future generations. Tyson describes this as a sort of immortality. Yet thanks to the written Word of God in the Bible, the good news of how to obtain eternal life is available to people all over the world.\n\nWriting and Cities\n\nAfter the global Flood about 4,350 years ago, humans\u2014the descendants of Noah's family\u2014got the opportunity to once again civilize the world. Defying God's command to spread out, they initially confined themselves to Mesopotamia, as described in Genesis 10 and 11. Therefore, after the Lord confused languages and forced the people to disperse from the Tower of Babel,1 civilization already had a head start in the \"land between the rivers.\"\n\nIn the post-Flood world, the first cities were built in this region ( Genesis 10:10 ). The people descended from Noah's family were intelligent and literate. They left written records of their presence\u2014poems, school exercises, trade notes, and so on. Tyson claims ancient Mesopotamian places \"invented\" cities and writing. Yet only evolutionary thinking would deceive us to think that the pre-Flood people lacked intelligence, literacy, and complex social structure\u2014yet Adam was even credited with a book that is mentioned by Moses ( Genesis 5:1 ).\n\nThe book of Genesis, written by Moses under the inspiration of God, reports some pre-Flood history. Moses, as he recorded the early history of man, may well have had access to copies of records of pre-Flood genealogies preserved by Noah. The first recorded city was built by Cain, according to Genesis 4:17 . The Bible records that those early generations made musical instruments, worked iron, and were highly skilled ( Genesis 4:21\u201322 ). Ancient Mesopotamia was simply the first place where civilization restarted after the global Flood.\n\nGilgamesh and Noah\n\nThe Epic of Gilgamesh contains one of the hundreds of flood legends that abound in cultures all over the world. These legends are ubiquitous because all people in the world are descendants of Noah's family, the only people to survive the global Flood.\n\nThe biblical global Flood happened about 4,350 years ago. The Epic of Gilgamesh, which contains a distorted account of the Flood, was written down in Mesopotamia, in the general region from which Abraham came. And it was probably written down on clay tablets at a time closer to Abraham's day than to Moses' time. Moses, inspired by God ( 2 Peter 1:21 ), wrote down the authentic account of the Flood, and it is preserved in the book of Genesis. Tyson asserts that the Akkadian epic, because it was written earlier than the Mosaic account, was the source of the Old Testament account. However, the source was the shared history of a real global Flood, not a shared piece of literature.\n\nThere is no justification for supposing the true history in the Bible to be a spin-off of the Gilgamesh epic.\n\nThe biblical historical account, recorded under the"}

Something simpler.\n\nIn 2011, we wrote a handful of songs, recorded our \"Storms Thrashing Our Vessel\" cd, and played a bunch of shows until the time that we met our mandolin player, Zach Zdziebko.\n\nIn 2012, we recorded our Blood Chronicles 7\" and did a little bit of West Coast touring to support the release.\n\nIn 2013, we set up a full United States tour all on our own. It was a challenge, it was grueling, it was a hell of a lot of gas money, but it was one of the most rewarding and exciting experiences we had ever been through. Later that year we added our drummer, Max Winston, to the equation. Having a drummer in the band really pushed us to another level and it was THEN that we decided that we would take all of 2014 off from playing shows, etc. to write our first full length album. That's just what we did and that brings us to right now.\n\nAdam is a Frog...\n\nSometimes the Shows Get Intense...\n\nA Basement in Pittsburgh...\n\nTHE NEW SOUNDS - Musically, we each come from different backgrounds, and we've all been writing, arranging, and contributing to this project, which has led us to create some really interesting sounds this time around. We've started playing through effects pedals and amplifiers using them to experiment with genres and styles, spanning from doo-wop to black metal to surf rock to math-core and beyond.\n\nOur music is inspired by, but not limited to, such themes as Ancient Egypt, Space, Killer Dolls, Puppets, Hell, Puppets From Hell, Puppet Master, Master Of Puppets, Spicy Ramen, Existentialism, Mortal Kombat 2, Killer Instinct, Extreme-Kendama and GWAR...\n\nRockin' the Suburbs...\n\nThe Manx + GWAR = THE GWANX...\n\nTHE RECORDING STUDIO - Instead of recording the songs ourselves, back in Tommy's cockroach infested apartment, we have a really amazing opportunity to record in an ACTUAL studio with a professional engineer/producer.\n\nSlick Studio Shot #1...\n\nOUR PRODUCER - Once we realized that we had written enough new material to finally record our first full length album, we reached out to a handful of producers and engineers, whom we respect and admire. We were excited to receive a response from one of our top choices, letting us know he was interested in working with us! He's worked with several of our favorite bands including The Melvins, Tweak Bird, Big Business, Solar Wimp, Foo Fighters, etc. Once we began to discuss the project with him, we realized just how perfect of a match he is for our unique sound.\n\nFloyd, Virginia...\n\nWHAT YOU'RE HELPING TO FUND - It's going to cost us $300 dollars a day to record our album. It will take us 10 days to record the entire thing.\n\n10 x $300 = $3,000.00\n\nMK2...\n\nREWARDS - We've got a ton of different options for you guys. Here are some pictures of a few of them!\n\nT-Shirts!!!

(Spin Master Entertainment)\n\nCanadian values like inclusivity and civic duty filter into the stories we tell and how we tell them \u2014 a key factor in our success with exporting kids shows abroad, Falcone explained.\n\nFor instance, Paw Patrol \"works in every country [where] it's launched,\" he said.\n\n\"[Kids] feel really empowered by the energy that those pups bring and the storytelling and good nature of the show. The civic duty that comes across in the show is remarkable.

They had the second most goals in the league in 1998-99 and 1999-00 and then led the league a year later.)\n\nStylistically, they've changed considerably under DeBoer, but perceptions for franchises are often very hard to shake.\n\nTo many, the Devils are still this no-nonsense, Scott Stevens led defensive squad that celebrated its three Cup wins in the parking lot -- even though they're now full of personality, led by Parise (who talked at length after Game 2 about how DeBoer pushes them to be aggressive in the offensive zone) and have a beautiful new rink that has a read-and-black pavilion out front to potentially parade around in.\n\nYes, this is another team with financial issues, with the new building not drawing as many fans as they'd like.\n\nYes, they're low on Canadian content, with Clarkson and Salvador two of only five skaters from this country.\n\nAnd, yes, GM Lou Lamoriello has a reputation for being crusty even if, like his team, that perception isn't reality.

{"id": 259848, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "Cost segregation benefits multifamily properties by accelerating depreciation.\n\n\nA cost segregation study identifies and reallocates personal property assets to shorten the depreciation time for income tax purposes, ultimately reducing current income tax obligations. Tangible personal property includes a building's non-structural elements, land improvements and indirect construction costs (e.g. architect's fees, permits, etc.). The primary goal of a cost segregation study is to identify all construction-related costs that can be depreciated over a shorter tax life (typically 5, 7 and 15 years) than the multifamily building (27\u00bd years for residential real property). Tangible personal property assets found in a cost segregation study generally include items that are affixed to the building but do not relate to the overall operation and maintenance of the building (e.g. carpeting, decorative lighting, crown molding, and specialty plumbing, just to name a few). This method of depreciation is called Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System, or MACRS.\n\nLand improvements generally include items \"outside\" a building that are pertinent to the land and do not relate to the overall operation and maintenance of a building. One exception to \"outside\" would be interior atriums with landscaped areas. Reducing tax lives of qualifying assets results in accelerated depreciation deductions, considerably reduced tax liability, and much increased cash flow.\n\nCost segregation benefits multifamily properties by accelerating depreciation in several ways. First, cost segregation identifies qualifying assets that are specific in nature to a multifamily property. An example would be a clubhouse featuring an elaborate commons area with crown molding, decorative lighting (e.g. chandelier, wall sconces, etc.), chair-rails, decorative window treatments, kitchen cabinetry, specialty plumbing and electrical, business center, high-speed internet, cable TV, recreation room, and much more. These are usually considered 5-year assets. On the exterior, the typical multifamily property would have security fencing, security gate with electronic entry, significant landscaping with architectural features, water fountains, pool w/fencing, significant drainage system, trash collection areas, mailbox centers, lighting, extensive parking, covered parking, curbs, sidewalks, and again, much more. These are usually considered 15-year assets.\n\nMultifamily properties include apartments of all sizes down to quadplexes, triplexes, and duplexes. They all qualify for cost segregation studies and can benefit significantly. In addition to providing substantially lower federal and state taxes, cost segregation can benefit multifamily properties in a myriad number of ways\u2026for example:\n\nCost segregation maximizes income tax savings by correcting the timing of deductions. When an asset's life is shortened, depreciation expense is accelerated and tax payments are decreased during the early stages of tangible personal property's life. This then releases cash for investment opportunities or current operating needs. Cost segregation creates an audit trail. Improper documentation of cost and asset classifications can lead to a negative audit adjustment. Properly documented and engineer-based cost segregation studies helps resolve IRS inquiries at the earliest stages avoiding lengthy AND costly litigation. IRC Sec. 481(a) adjustment Cost segregation delivers automatic catch-up of earned but unrealized depreciation through. This is considered Retroactivity. Beginning in 1996, taxpayers can capture immediate retroactive tax savings on multifamily property (or any for that matter) built or acquired since January 1, 1987. Prior rules that provided a four-year catch-up period for retroactive savings have been amended for cost segregation studies. Now, with cost segregation applied, taxpayers are allowed to take 100% of their Sec. 481(a) adjustment in the year cost segregation is applied. This opportunity to recapture unrecognized, yet earned, depreciation in one year represents an amazing opportunity to perform cost segregation studies on older properties to increase cash flow in the current year. This type of cost segregation is called a \"look-back\" study. Cost segregation delivers other ancillary benefits as well. Cost segregation can reveal opportunities to reduce real estate tax liabilities and identify certain sales and use tax savings opportunities. Additionally, due to cost segregation being applied, property insurance premiums can be lowered since tangible personal property costs less to insure than real property. Cost segregation can reduce the mortgage interest rate. When cost segregation is applied prior to the purchase or construction start, many lenders will lower interest rates up to 100 basis points due to the debt-service reduction. In other instances a lender may reduce or eliminate the need for down payment due to the additional cash flow afforded by cost segregation.\n\nCost segregation is a tax-planning tool that no multifamily property owner should ignore. However, as an aside, let's briefly address a recent news article related to multifamily properties and cost segregation in the news.\n\nThe recent \"AmeriSouth XXXII, Ltd. v. IRS\" case appeared to shed some negative light on cost segregation. The tax court ruled in favor of the IRS with the full details shown in T.C. Memo. 2012"}

Or an easy to acquire following for your cause. Or fans if you are a music artist. Etcetera.\n\nThe best marketing is word of mouth and Reddit, Hacker News and Voat are word of mouth on steroids. Reddit upvotes and downvotes can bring a lot of positive cash flow and recognition to any startup or already established business; it does it fast, in less than 24 hours.

Actually at the time when we're writing this, the first few websites that appear on Google when searching for \"buy Reddit upvotes\" are actually scams. We know because we've tried them ourselves. First off, they're slow. They won't start upvoting as soon as you place the order. They'll wait 24 hours so that moderator traffic goes off the post in cause and they can upvote it with less risk. The accounts that they use are extremely low quality and most of the upvotes won't count. They'll justify it with \"you've been downvoted as well, it's out of our control!\". Some are even so uninterested in providing a quality service that they are using software like \"Reddit Automation Bot\", \"Reddit Account Creator and Upvoater\" or \"Reddit Dominator\". With all these low quality services, your accounts will generally be banned in less than one week. If you're lucky, it can take up to ninety days. The services on Fiverr and SEOclerks related to this are even worse. Do you actually believe someone will give you 40 upvotes for five dollars? And do it manually? Just one person? No.\n\nIf it seems too good to be true, it's a scam. There's no putting it lightly when it comes to this subject: over eighty percent of the industry is a scam. Of the remaining twenty percent, most, even though they don't try to cheat you, provide a low-quality service. It's usually just one man having registered a bunch of accounts and upvoting with them through software. It's inefficient and risky. A ticking bomb waiting to be banned with everything that he's got.\n\nWe are a team of eleven persons which use Reddit ten hours per day. Most of us have been doing this for over five years.

That's because the tickets are worth far more on the secondary market.\n\nFriday's memo also stated there must be \"a clear and direct connection between the official's attendance and the performance of such ceremonial duty or action and the nature and location of the event itself.\" It goes on to cite as examples the mayor or alderman whose ward includes the venue \u2014 which in the case of Wrigley Field is Ald. Tom Tunney, 44th.\n\nEmanuel spokesman Adam Collins said the mayor \"hasn't finalized\" his plans for the World Series games at Wrigley Field. Tunney spokeswoman Kim Shepherd said the alderman has yet to discuss the issue with the Cubs.\n\nGreen, meanwhile, declined to answer whether the team had made a ticket offer to Emanuel or Tunney.\n\n\"We haven't spent much time thinking about the exceptions,\" Green said. \"We've been too busy celebrating. ... Our focus should be on baseball, and this issue has become a complete distraction during one of the most historic runs in Cubs history.\"\n\nFor more than a decade, the Cubs have offered playoff tickets at face value to federal, state and city officials, even though the mayor and aldermen determine the rules and regulations under which the team can alter their ballpark and do business.\n\nThis year, the ethics board took a new stance under Conlon, who was recently appointed the panel's chairman. But the ethics panel also determined the officials could attend under a \"hosting exception,\" thus the new interpretation of city rules that certain officials could attend if they perform a ceremonial duty.\n\nThe new rules also would apply to regular season games \u2014 and offers from other city sports teams \u2014 in cases where the market value of the ticket exceeds the face value by more than $50. Public officials are still free to buy tickets on the open market like anyone else.\n\nIf aldermen were to break the rule as newly interpreted and were found in violation, they could face a fine for each infraction ranging from $1,000 to $5,000.\n\nhdardick@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @ReporterHal"}

While pregnant with twins, she lost one of them at 30 weeks. The other baby, Kinsleigh, was born with serious heart problems.\n\nBut Barnes is angry because her insurance company, Aetna, held up paying thousands of dollars in medical charges. The reason? The insurance company said the newborn might have been suffering from a pre-existing condition.\n\n\"I don't know how something could be pre-existing in a baby, so it was very shocking to me to see something like that,\" Barnes told \"Good Morning America.\" \"It's a slap in the face. Her medical bills are the last thing I should be worrying about. I should know that my baby is being taken care of.\"\n\n\"Under Aetna's own definition, in order to deny for pre-existing condition, there has to be medical advice or care that was rendered or given,\" Barnes' attorney, Tom Caldwell, said. \"And in this case, of course, that would be real hard, given the fact the baby was still in the womb.\"\n\nBarnes said she called Aetna hoping for a resolution.\n\n\"It's like you're talking to somebody who is reading from a script,\" Barnes said. \"They don't have answers for you based on what you're telling them.\"\n\nFinally, Barnes contacted \"GMA.\" We called the insurance company in September and they claim that the pre-existing condition hold up was a simple coding error and have been paying back Barnes' claims since July. But Barnes said that no one ever told her that and it wasn't until \"GMA\" got involved that all the costs were finally paid this week.\n\n\"It is my personal belief that they will -- they do this to you, expecting you not to follow up with it,\" she said. \"And I'm sure most people don't.\"\n\nConsumer expert Deann Friedholm said what Barnes experienced is not uncommon.\n\n\"It really might be a clerical error, but let's face it, it is in the company's interest to not pay bills. The fewer bills they pay, the better their bottom line is,\" Friedholm said.\n\nKinsleigh still needs heart operations, but those Aetna said they'll be paying for.

It's an idea that occurs to many drivers who experience winter weather: If I have to mount snow tires every year, why don't I just keep them on my vehicle all the time?\n\nUnfortunately, using snow tires year round isn't recommended. In the long run, it will cost more money than changing them out and could compromise your vehicle's performance on the road. That's why tire makers offer different types of tires for different seasons \u2013 the best option for you is determined by many factors including climate, driving style, and performance needs.\n\nHere are some specific reasons why year-round use of winter tires is not advised. And if it's the hassle of tire mounting, unmounting, and remounting that you're tired of, we've included an idea for simplifying that process, too.\n\nFirst, what is a Winter Tire?\n\nAll winter tires, whether studless or studded, are made to maintain better traction in extreme cold, and on icy, snowy, or slushy roads. The rubber is able to remain softer, which makes it more flexible, allowing the tire to conform to the road better in extremely cold conditions. This feature, along with deeper tread depths and specialized tread designs, are what make snow/winter tires ideal for inclement winter weather and extreme cold driving conditions.\n\nWe use this analogy - tennis shoes. Yes, you can wear tennis shoes on the beach or in the snow, but wouldn't it be better to have flip flops on the beach and boots for the snow? Winter tires are like snow boots for your car.\n\nWhy You Shouldn't Use Winter Tires Year-Round\n\nWinter tires are specially designed for cold temperatures and winter precipitation. Once it gets warm, you won't need deep tread depths to handle snow or biting edges for traction on ice. Here are some specific reasons why using winter tires year round is not recommended.\n\nFaster wear on warm, dry pavement - the tread rubber of winter tires is considerably more flexible than that of all season and summer tires. That same pliable tread rubber that adds traction in winter will wear down quickly in warm temperatures. Summer and all-season tires are built to withstand warm temperatures, providing long wear life.\n\nDecreased performance - In warm weather, winter tires won't provide the same handling capabilities as summer or all-season tires. Imagine if you needed to make a quick maneuver and your tires were soft and squishy. You won't get the crisp response from a winter tire in warm weather. Winter tires need that flexibilitity to handle ice and snow, but it's not as useful in warm weather.\n\nThe specialized compounds and tread designs of winter tires are not designed for optimal warm climate performance and wear. Generally speaking, the softer tread of a winter tire will wear out faster in warmer temperatures. If you keep winter tires on your vehicle after winter has come and gone, you will have to replace them sooner than had you removed them for springtime.\n\nThat's why using snow tires year round is more expensive than mounting them seasonally. The sooner they wear out, the sooner you have to replace them.\n\nSimplify Tire Re-Mounting\n\nDriving on snow tires year-round could compromise optimal tread wear and ultimately be more expensive than just changing tires out for the season.\n\nIf you were considering year-round use of winter tires because you were tired of having to change them, here's an idea that could save you time and money. Purchase wheels with the same diameter and bolt pattern as your current wheels. Mount your snow tires on those and store them in the garage until winter arrives.\n\nInstead of having to change out your tires each season, just have a technician change the wheels. It's a quick, relatively inexpensive alternative to mounting and unmounting snow tires every season."}

They think about it, dream about it, obsess about it... but they never accomplish it.\n\nThat could be because they also talk about it.\n\nAccording to studies like this one, people who talk about their intentions are less likely to follow through on those intentions.\n\nSay you want to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail, a grueling five- to seven-month trek from Georgia to Maine. (Having completed about 2% of it, I'm not so well on my way.)\n\nYou're having dinner with friends, and you tell them about it.\n\n\"Oh, wow!\" one exclaims. \"That sounds amazing. But won't it be super hard?\"\n\nIndeed it will, you say, and you share what you know about tent sites, shelters, too-occasional showers, and the cool trail name you'll get.\n\nIt's fun. It feels awesome to bask in the glow of people who admire you for wanting to take on such a huge challenge.\n\nIt feels like you're already on the Trail.\n\nIt also means you're less likely to actually be on the Trail someday, because \"when other people take notice of an individual's identity-related behavioral intention, this gives the individual a premature sense of possessing the aspired-to identity.\"\n\nIn short, you already got a kick out of people thinking of you as a Trail hiker... so now you're less motivated to actually be a Trail hiker.\n\nSounds counterintuitive, right? Aren't we supposed to share our intentions so other people can help support and motivate us?\n\nAccording to NYU psychologist Peter Gollwitzer, one of the authors of the study, that's not the case.\n\nGollwitzer thinks the issue lies in our sense of identity. Each of us wants to be certain things, and we naturally declare those intentions, even if we have not yet become those things. (Check out Twitter profiles bios if you don't believe me--tons of people are motivated, innovative, creative, passionate, and unique gurus, ninjas, and connoisseurs.)\n\nDescribing how I plan to run a marathon, and how I bought running shoes and joined a gym and created a training plan, certainly makes me feel good... but it also makes me feel like I'm already part of the way there even though I haven't trained at all.\n\nDeclaring what we want to be and how we will get there causes us to somehow feel we are farther along the path of becoming who we want to be, and therefore less motivated--even though we've actually done nothing but talk.\n\nSo try it. Pick a goal. Create a plan to achieve it. Then keep your goal and your plan to yourself. Focus solely on doing the work required to achieve your goal."}

He eyed her suspiciously before he lightly pushed Zhao Chengning and asked, \"What happened to my sister? Why's her face so red?\"\n\n\nZhao Chengning glanced playfully at Shen Jingbin's flushed cheeks and said, \"I don't know either.\"\n\n\nShen Jingchen noticed that little glance of his and immediately understood what was going on. He broke out into a radiant smile and hooked his arm over Shen Jingbin's neck. \"Hey, sis! Are you feeling embarrassed? What did Ah Ning do to make you feel so embarrassed? Come on, tell your big bro!\"\n\n\nShen Jingbin felt disgusted by how ecstatic he sounded at the end. She grabbed ahold of his arm that was draped over her neck, and threw him over her shoulder.\n\n\n\"What the f*ck\u2026\" Shen Jingchen only had enough time to scream out in alarm, before he landed on the ground with a bang. \"Shen Jingbin, are you trying to kill me?!

You should be hanged for having lived till now.\"\n\n\nShen Jingchen kneaded his waist as he stood up. Gritting his teeth, he glanced at Zhao Chengning who was clearly enjoying the show and said, \"Ah Ning, you better take a good look for yourself. This girl is a barbarian! You'll be the one on the receiving end of this if you marry her in the future!\"\n\n\n\"Shen Jingchen, are you really looking for a beating?!\"\n\n\n\"Hey, hey, hey. Calm down for a moment.

It might have been through sheer luck or some other occurrence, but they managed to get a seat by the window.\n\nAs it was between peak hours, there currently wasn't many people in Starbucks, so Shen Jingchen soon arrived with their coffee.\n\nThe trio drank their coffee and started to idly chat, which consisted mostly of Shen Jingchen asking questions and Zhao Chengning answering them, with Shen Jingbin silently listening at the side.\n\nZhao Chengning sat opposite Shen Jingbin, while Shen Jingchen sat next to her. Out of respect, Zhao Chengning would look at Shen Jingchen when he spoke to him. However, she had this feeling that he wasn't looking at Shen Jingchen, but rather he was looking at her.\n\nWhy did she suddenly feel sorry for Shen Jingchen?\n\nWhen they were just about done with their coffee, a group of youngsters suddenly walked through the door. Amongst them was a slightly older looking woman.

After years in purgatory and a Nokia acquisition that didn't exactly lead to anything major, we now have two Lumia phones that are trying it all again: the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL. Both were oft-leaked devices \u2014 so much so that we came into this event already knowing the big points. They're running a version of Windows 10, which Microsoft is betting will help jump-start their third-party app ecosystems. They have the same basic specs we've seen on a lot of phones lately: Qualcomm Snapdragon processors of varying strength depending on the phone size, plenty of RAM, 32GB of storage, USB Type-C, and your choice of two pretty large screens. Hell, Microsoft even says that they're liquid cooled, which is crazy.\n\nBut since this is actually an all-new phone platform (that, admittedly, looks really similar to Windows Phone 8 before it), digging into the internal specs is a little beside the point. You never know what those internals mean on a whole new OS until you try it \u2014 so we tried it. The result: Windows Phone is just as snappy and fluid as it was before. Even though it has something like the full power of Windows behind it (so much so that you can actually hook up a full-sized monitor and use it as a mini computer), it still feels like the stripped-down and fast UI we've seen before.\n\nThat's mainly a good thing. You don't have to wait around to do anything, you just have to get familiar with the platform and how it works. You also have to accept that you might not have all the apps you can get on the iPhone or Android \u2014 yet. Microsoft has secured promises from a few companies (notably, Facebook) to get universal apps working on Windows Phone.\n\nSnapping a couple photos with the 20-megapixel sensor isn't enough to render full judgement, but I will say this: They didn't choke in very low lighting conditions. I'd say that Microsoft has leaned more towards Samsung's philosophy of trying to get a usable image rather than being precisely true to the scene the way Apple is. Either way, the fact that I was getting usable images at all in the space we're in was actually kind of impressive. So far, so good, but I definitely didn't get very far with it just yet.\n\nNondescript looks, but powerful insides\n\nAs for looks, well, they're about as nondescript as we'e seen in recent memory. The 5.2-and 5.7-inch screens (950 and 950 XL, respectively) sit inside bezels that could stand to be a bit smaller \u2014 but they're still plenty acceptable when compared to an iPhone 6s or 6S Plus. The back is plastic (or polycarbonate, if you must), and comes in black, white, or cyan. Microsoft isn't doing anything whimsical or even especially daring with the basic slab design, but there's some kind of honor in simplicity.\n\nIn terms of features, the two big stories are Continuum and Windows Hello. I didn't get a chance to try out Hello, but I did play with Continuum for a bit. Against all expectations, I feel like it could actually be the real deal. I was super impressed.\n\nContinuum is surprisingly good\n\nYou hook up to an external display using a heavy little dock that Microsoft is selling. You can have a different app running on the display than you do on your phone, which means it's slightly more powerful than what you'll get with Apple's AirPlay or Google's Chromecast features. Actually, you can have several apps running at once. Continuum can't do full windowing with those apps, but I had four of them open and could switch between them fast enough to know they weren't getting put to sleep in the background (Outlook, Edge, Groove Music, and Powerpoint, for the record).\n\nThere's also the Lumia 550, Microsoft's low end phone. For the past couple years, just about the only widespread success Windows Phone has seen has come from the low end. It makes sense: Windows Phone 7 and 8 both were phone operating systems that still felt fast even if the internals weren't great. So even though we now have two new Windows 10-based flagships, Microsoft needed to make sure it didn't give up on the bread-and-butter. It's only $139, and it has low-end specs to match. But even though it's small, thick, and has a measly 5-megapixel camera, at that price it should do well for Microsoft.\n\nThe big question is whether the Lumia 950 and 950 XL can do equally as well. Prices start at $549 and though Continuum is impressive, I don't know that it's impressive enough to make me want to give up the apps I know are available right now on other"}

Overall, the Heat are 4-4-0-1 through nine games and sit in third place in the West Division and eighth in the Western Conference.\n\nHEAT @ COMETS\n\nThe Abbotsford Heat and Utica Comets (AHL affiliate of the Vancouver Canucks) will begin a new rivalry in the AHL beginning tonight. The two out of division squads will play 12 times this season, which is the most of any opponent the Heat will match-up against. The Comets have struggled out of the gates and have yet to pick up their first win and sit at 0-5-0-1. They played twice over last weekend and lost on Friday 2-1 against Syracuse in a shootout and on Saturday dropped a 3-2 decision to Hamilton. The Canucks affiliate are currently in the midst of a six game home stand and have averaged 3,489 fans at the 4000 seat Utica Memorial Auditorium through their first three home games. The Comets are led by Pascal Pelletier who has registered eight points in five games.\n\nHEAT @ BULLDOGS\n\nSaturday night will mark the first of eight meetings between the Heat and Bulldogs. Hamilton is off to a solid start as they sit tied for first place in the North Division with a record of 4-2-0-2. Last year the season series was dead even with the Heat earning a 4-4-0-0 record in the eight games with both teams scoring 18 goals apiece. The all-time record has the Heat owning a 14-12-1-1 record against the Montreal Canadiens affiliate, but has struggled at Copps Coliseum at 6-7-0-1.

It's about me, what I'm going to do and what I'm going to leave behind. I'm doing it because I want to do it now rather than anything else. A good few times over the last few years, it's in the back of my head \u2013 is this the one?\n\n\"They (UFC) told me to go off and have a fight, but at the moment I don't really give a shit. When I'm old and I'm smoking a pipe and my grandkids ask me about my fighting days, I want to have one perfect fight so I can say \u2013 'that's the one'.\n\n\"I want that one perfect performance.

For instance, the American Petroleum Institute, which began in 1919 as a trade group for domestic oil companies, is now led in part by a Saudi government lobbyist and has offices in Singapore, Beijing and Dubai. ExxonMobil and Chevron are reportedly among the highest dues-paying members of API, but so is Aramco, the state-owned Saudi oil company. (The American Petroleum Institute, as Bloomberg has reported, now transfers money to attack ad groups like the 60 Plus Association.)\n\nHere's the rub. Citizens United allows trade associations, for the first time, to dip into their general treasuries\u2014made up in many cases of both foreign and domestic money from businesses\u2014and spend unlimited amounts on American elections. Before the Supreme Court began taking an axe to campaign finance, if a trade association wanted to spend on a federal election, it had to spin off a regulated and disclosed political action committee. Though foreigners can't manage a PAC, they are more than welcome to manage major trade associations like the American Petroleum Institute.\n\nHere's how it plays out this year.\n\nChemical companies do not want Tammy Baldwin, the Democratic Senate candidate in Wisconsin, to win. In addition to voting to move our energy system towards a clean economy and away from petrochemicals, she's a strong advocate for regulating carcinogens in household products, like cosmetics. But instead of beating her with an ordinary PAC or a campaign contribution to her opponent, the trade association for the chemical industry has chosen to take advantage of the Citizens United loophole to use undisclosed general treasury funds against Baldwin.\n\nThe American Chemistry Council made one of the biggest media buys in the Senate race in August by purchasing $648,600 worth of ads supporting Baldwin's opponent, former Republican Governor Tommy Thompson. Here's the ad:\n\nThe American Chemistry Council used its 501(c)(6) fund rather than its PAC, so it does not have to disclose where it got that money. The council has also used its 501(c)(6) to air ads in support of Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) and other pro-chemical industry politicians of both parties.\n\nWhere does the Chemistry Council's general treasury, otherwise known as its 501(c)(6), receive its funds? Well, according to its website, the largest foreign chemical companies in the world\u2014Saudi Arabia's state-owned SABIC, the Chinese-owned Sinopec corporation and Japan's Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation\u2014are dues-paying members, alongside American giants like DuPont and Dow Chemical.\n\nThe American Petroleum Institute also used its foreign-funded 501(c)(6) to air its own ads against senators like McCaskill.\n\nIn some rare cases, subsidiaries of foreign-owned corporations have decided to skip the trade association route and spend disclosed dollars on US elections. Recently, OdysseyRe, a subsidiary of a Canadian financial services company, gave $1 million to the pro-Romney Super PAC. As I reported earlier this year, 7-Eleven Corporation, which is owned by a Japanese holding company, gave to a Super PAC supporting Senator Dick Lugar (R-IN) during his primary.\n\nWhen the next Congress is gaveled in this January, a good number of lawmakers will owe their seats to groups financed in part by foreign-owned corporations. In the case of the American Chemistry Council and American Petroleum Institute, two Saudi-funded pro-oil lobbies active in the election, that could have wide ranging ramifications for our energy security.\n\nFor more on the plutocratic consequences of Citizens United, read Lee Fang on who's running the pro-Romney Super PACs."}

At some point, someone somewhere in the US government had an amazing idea: why not build a compressed natural gas (CNG) filling station in Afghanistan? Forty-three million taxpayer dollars later, the city of Sheberghan, in the far north of the country, got its gas station. But, according to the watchdog agency probing Afghanistan reconstruction spending, nobody seems to know \u2014 or wants to admit \u2014 who signed off on the project or how its costs spiraled so completely out of control.\n\nThe whole thing is so strange and wrongheaded that the crazily high price tag \u2014 more than 100 times what a similar facility would cost in neighboring Pakistan \u2014 is not even the worst thing the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) found.\n\nNatural Gas? For what Cars?\n\nEven more troubling than the high price tag is that there was no point in building the gas station in the first place. While Afghanistan has vast natural gas reserves, it does not have a sufficient number of cars that run on natural gas, and converting a vehicle literally costs as much as the average Afghan earns in a year.\n\nHad a feasibility study been conducted, somebody probably would have figured this out, but SIGAR found no evidence of such a precaution having been taken.\n\nYou might think the Department of Defense (DOD) would want to get to the bottom of this waste of money. After all, the project was part of the Task Force for Stability and Business Operations (TFBSO), which was created by the Deputy Secretary of Defense and reported directly to the Office of the Secretary.\n\nInstead, DOD stonewalled.\n\n\"One of the most troubling aspects of this project is that the Department of Defense claims that it is unable to provide an explanation for the high cost of the project or to answer any other questions concerning its planning, implementation, or outcome,\" SIGAR John Sopko wrote in a letter to Defense Secretary Ashton Carter.\n\nDid the Dog Eat the Records?\n\nDOD's excuse for its lack of cooperation is that TFBSO, an $800 million program, was shut down in March of 2015 and now nobody is around to address SIGAR's questions. That didn't sit well with Sopko, who recently gave an exclusive interview to WhoWhatWhy in which he discussed the staggering amount of taxpayer funds wasted in Afghanistan.\n\n\"Frankly, I find it both shocking and incredible that DOD asserts that it no longer has any knowledge about TFBSO, an $800 million program that reported directly to the Office of the Secretary of Defense and only shut down a little over six months ago,\" he wrote to Carter.\n\nSopko vowed to continue the investigation to determine \"whether any conduct by TFBSO staff or contractors was criminal in nature\" \u2014 as opposed to just crazily lucrative \u2014 for some well-connected insiders.\n\nRelated front page panorama photo credit: CNG Pump Nozzle (Andreas Geick / Wikimedia).\n\nWhere else do you see journalism of this quality and value?

As the former Strikeforce Lightweight champion, SAP Center was his home away from home, the site for his historic set of trilogy of matches against \"El Nino\" Gilbert Melendez.\n\nExpectations were certainly high for Thomson when Strikeforce was acquired and he officially became a part of Ultimate Fighting Championship. And his second round technical knockout of Nate Diaz certainly suggested he was primed to make a run for the gold again.\n\nHowever, two controversial split decisions and a decision loss to Tony Ferguson later, plans changed. And it suddenly seemed like the pastures might be greener on the other side, where his former Strikeforce boss, Coker. was now the man in charge at Bellator MMA.\n\nMMAmania.com recently spoke with Thomson about his decision to turn down UFC's offer and join Bellator and what his plans are for his promotional debut against \"The Greek\" Mike Bronzoulis at Bellator 142: \"Dynamite 1\" this Saturday night (Sept. 19, 2015).\n\nFor Thomson the most important thing coming into Bellator was getting an offer on paper that wouldn't damage a long-time friendship.\n\n\"Look you can be friends with somebody, but when you do business with friends, you get a little concerned. You don't want to step on each others toes, you don't want to piss each other off, you don't want to slap them in the face. The relationship that him and I have, it's not just fighting, it's not just he's my promoter -- there's a friendship there. It's like, 'Hey let's get some coffee, let's go play golf.' You don't want to ruin that ... especially over business.\"\n\nThomson didn't just want to join Bellator to reunite with an old friend, though, and he wasn't afraid to show us the math on how he does better financially without the Reebok apparel restrictions.\n\n\"When you look at what I made for the last fight right? I made $5,000 from the Reebok deal. (This time) I haven't even fought yet and I'm already at about $35,000 for this fight. It makes it a lot easier to go ahead and move forward, and that's only with just a couple of sponsors. That's not counting the other sponsors that are potentially going to come with. Regardless, I'm still already $30,000 ahead. On top of my fight purse is going to be a lot more money.\"\n\nTo Thomson age is just a number once the cage door shuts.\n\n\"Of course I'm going to be 37 like a day or two after the fight. There's no secret that I'm getting older, but the will to win is definitely still there. Anyone that's seen my Benson (Henderson) fight or my last fight -- there's no doubt that I still want to win. I have too much pride not to want to go out there and lay it all on the line.\"\n\n\"Punk\" doesn't get his feathers ruffled too easily after being around for so long in this sport, but he does scoff at the notion from Bronzoulis that a win would elevate him to Lightweight contender status ... or vice versa.\n\n\"I think the talent that's in the organization, from (Michael) Chandler to (David) Rickels to Will Brooks -- I don't even think it's even in the conversation to be honest. And I'm being very up front. There was never an expectation I was going to come into this organization, fight Mike Bronzoulis or fight Chandler, and not have to still fight Rickels or somebody else to even get to Will Brooks. When I negotiated the contract, that was never even the conversation.\"\n\nIt's not a coincidence that Rickels' name came up at the same time Thomson shot down the idea of an instant title opportunity.\n\n\"I honestly believed that Rickels was going to be my first fight. It just so happened that he had booked a vacation, and he was just on the first day of his vacation when we called to see if he was interested in the fight, so that fight fell through. I'm definitely excited to fight these guys. I have nothing but respect for them.\"\n\nThomson also has a healthy respect for Bronzoulis, but he still plans to collect that aforementioned winner's purse.\n\n\"I'm excited about it all, I'm excited to be a part of it, but I have to win fights. By winning fights, that'll kind of answer everything. Right now, it's about getting past Mike. And the fact that he thinks that way, man I don't know whatever! He can think that way. That"}

Frequently, previous incarnations of the UN talks have finished one or even two days after deadline.\n\nFabius vowed in an interview to forge an agreement that would be \"universal, legally binding, durable and dynamic\".\n\nIn the wake of the attacks, Fabius confirmed that security would be tightened around the conference centre, which is on the outskirts of Paris, near the airport where a planned attack was foiled and not far from the St-Denis district where the attacks were planned. There will be a total lockdown on the area of Paris surrounding the conference centre on Sunday afternoon, when many of the heads of state and government are expected to arrive, in time for the first official day of talks on Monday.\n\nFabius praised the climate activists who had agreed to call off their planned march through Paris as a result of the attacks. \"I have to salute the responsibility of the organisations who would have liked to demonstrate but who understand that if they demonstrate in a public place there is a security risk, or even a risk of panic.\"\n\nHe said: \"The first week [of the fortnight-long talks] will be devoted to reducing the number of options in the text,\" in which delegates have suggested multiple alternatives in wording on certain issues. \"I will ask that by [next] Saturday midday the text will be transmitted to me, the president of the COP, and at that moment everyone will know where we are and the procedure to follow. Obviously, I hope a maximum number of options will have been lifted but I will have to take into account the situation at that moment.\"\n\nIn a veiled reference to the situation at the last climate summit in Copenhagen, when negotiations were thrown into chaos by rumours of a draft text that had been circulated to some governments, he added: \"I don't have a text in my pocket that I can pull out. I have found with the delegations that there is a real willingness to move forward, a willingness to be transparent.\n\n\"If there is no agreement by Saturday, of course I will take the initiative. I will see the different groups with the facilitators,\" he said. \"Success is at our door, but it is not yet won.\"\n\nFabius, speaking in his resplendent office in France's foreign ministry, was in ebullient mood. Amply gilded and frescoed, with French windows looking out on to ornamental gardens on the banks of the Seine, the ministry was built with the intention of impressing France's many allies, and potential enemies.\n\nThe French are hoping that the discord that has marked previous talks, preventing a legal agreement at the last climate summit in Copenhagen in 2009, will be averted by meticulous planning. Fabius, despite his punishing schedule since the atrocities in Paris, has been habitually squeezing questions on climate change into every meeting with his foreign counterparts and heads of state, as has the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.\n\nBefore the talks, governments responsible for more than 90% of global emissions \u2013 including all major developed economies and most of the biggest developing nations, such as China and India \u2013 have laid out plans for cuts or curbs to their emissions. These will form the centrepiece of any deal, and even if a deal is not reached, these commitments will be hard for governments to renege on.\n\nFabius said the COP 21 talks were \"a success in terms of numbers and actions\" pledged by countries on emissions reductions. \"If we add together all these contributions, we avoid catastrophe, in the form of the consequences of inaction, a world four, five or six degrees [warmer]. But we are still not at 2C or 1.5C, which is the goal of Paris.\"\n\nParis climate summit: the climate circus comes to town | Suzanne Goldenberg Read more\n\nScientists estimate that if the world warms by more than 2C on average above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century, the effects of climate change will become catastrophic and irreversible"}

Those in power have simply convinced themselves that the people do not understand what is good for them so they must impose their will upon the people but raw force. How does this differ in any what from the justification of imposing communism? This is the death of all freedom and it is upon our doorstep.\n\nHere are the new laws in Spain:\n\n1. If you photograph security personnel and then share these images on social media: up to \u20ac30.000 fine (particularly if photo exposes violence used against a member of the public). This fine could increase depending on the number of Instagram or social media followers you have.\n\n2. Tweet or retweet information or the \"location of an organized protest\" can now be interpreted as an act of terrorism as it incites others to \"commit a crime\" (now that \"demonstrating\" in many ways has become a crime). Sound \"1984\"-ish? Read about Orwell and his time in Spain.\n\n3. Snowden-like whistle blowing is now defined as an act of terrorism. If you write for a local publication, be careful what you print, whom you speak to, and whether the government is listening.\n\n4. Visiting or consulting terrorist websites \u2013 even for investigative purposes \u2013 can be interpreted as an act of terrorism. Make sure you use \"Tor\" browser, reject cookies, and don't allow pop-ups. Not to mention, don't post it on your Facebook timeline!\n\n5. Be careful with the royal jokes! Any satirical comment against the royal family is a new crime \"against the Crown\". For example, \"What did Leticia and the Bishop have to say after they \u2013\u2013\" (SORRY CENSORED).\n\n6. No more hassling elected members of the government or local authorities \u2013 even if they say one thing in order to be elected, but then go and do the exact opposite. Confronting them about this hypocritical behavior. Even if you see them in the street chatting to a street cleaner, dining at their favorite expensive restaurant, or having their shoes shined by that physics graduate who cannot find a decent job in the country, hassling them about their behavior is now a criminal offence.\n\n7. Has your local river been so polluted by that plastic factory along the edge that all life has extinguished? Well, tough! Greenpeace or similar protests are now finable from \u20ac601\u2013\u20ac30.000.\n\n8. Protests in a spontaneous way outside Parliament are now illegal. For example if Parliament passes a hugely unpopular bill, or are debating something extremely important to you or your community, it is now finable from \u20ac601 \u2013 \u20ac30.000. Tip: Use Google Maps to protest just around the corner \u2013 but don't tweet the location!\n\n9. Obstructing an officer in the course of their business, \"resisting arrest\", refusing to leave a demonstration when told, or getting in the way of a swinging baton are all now finable offences from \u20ac601 \u2013 \u20ac30.000.\n\n10. Showing lack of respect to officers of the law is an immediate fine of \u20ac100 \u2013 \u20ac600. Answering back, asking a disrespectful question, making a funny face, showing your bottom to an officer of the law, or telling him/her that their breath reminds you of your dog's underparts is now, sadly, not advisable.\n\n11. Occupying, squatting, or refusing to leave an office, business, bank or other place until your complaint has been heard as a protest is now a \u20ac100 \u2013 \u20ac600 fine (no more flash mobs).\n\n12. Digital protests: Writing something that could technically \"disturb the peace\" is a now a crime. Bloggers beware, for no one has yet defined whose peace you could be disturbing."}

The Tigers are now 6-2 overall and are still alive in the SEC West race at 4-1.\n\nHowever, just because the Tigers won big Saturday doesn't mean it was a clean game, as Auburn still has plenty to work on moving forward.\n\nWith games still remaining against Texas A&M, Georgia and Alabama in the next few weeks, Malzahn and his staff need to make a few changes and shore up a few areas.\n\nHere are three big things that Auburn needs to fix:\n\nThe defense is susceptible to big plays\n\nThe Tigers played well on defense, holding the Razorbacks to 20 points (seven of which came on a kickoff return).\n\nHowever, Auburn still allowed 10 plays of 15 yards or more. Against a team like Arkansas, that's worrisome, as there are squads with better offenses remaining on the Tigers' schedule.\n\nIf defensive coordinator Kevin Steele can't shore up the holes, Georgia and Alabama are going to torch the Tigers.\n\nThe kick coverage team needs to be better\n\nFortunately, the Tigers have Daniel Carlson as their kicker, otherwise kickoff coverage might be an even bigger problem.\n\nThe Razorbacks only attempted one kickoff return, and De'Vion Warren went 100 yards for a touchdown.\n\nCarlson can't kick every ball out of the back of the end zone, so at some point, the Tigers are going to need to make some tackles on kickoffs against some talented returners.\n\nThe lapse didn't hurt the Tigers on Saturday night, but it did take some of the shine off of the preceding Auburn touchdown, which came on an incredible reverse pass by WR Ryan Davis to WR Darius Slayton.\n\nChip Lindsey's play calling is still too predictable\n\nThough first-year offensive coordinator Chip Lindsey had a better effort against the Razorbacks than he did against LSU last week, his play-calling still left a lot to be desired.\n\nAfter running it 17 straight times on first downs in the second half of last week's loss, Lindsey did an incredibly predictable thing by throwing it on Auburn's first play of the Arkansas game (an incompletion, naturally).\n\nEven when things were working against the hopeless Arkansas defense, they weren't working because of the defenders being fooled \u2014 Auburn is just better than Arkansas.\n\nOther than the trick play mentioned above, the Tigers' offense wasn't exactly creative in Fayetteville.\n\nDown near the goal line late in the first half, Lindsey dialed up a couple of runs for star RB Kerryon Johnson \u2014 which is normally a good idea. However, having Johnson plunge straight into the heart of the Arkansas defense twice in a row is the sort of unimaginative play-calling that's going to hurt the Tigers down the stretch."}

For instance, they wanted to stick to the visual look of the Uncharted series, including the expressive use of colors.\n\nBut they also had to tackle a challenge that the team didn't have to face on past Uncharted titles: this DLC was only taking place in one location, instead of spanning several continents. In a sense, the country-hopping in the other games made it easy to create what they call a \"progressions of looks.\" For The Lost Legacy, the team had to try to make one single area feel much more diverse.\n\nThe location gave the team a gift however, in the form of the real-world reference point: what Mosesian calls the \"really beautiful and intricate and stunningly awesome\" Dravidian architecture style that developed thousands of years ago in South India.\n\nThe game's memorable structures and artifacts and obstacles are the result of carefully studying real world referents...but also knowing when to take liberties.\n\n***\n\nThe team drew from the several distinct Dravidian empires from different historical eras: Pallava (AD 600-900), Chola (AD 848\u20131280), and the Hoysalas (AD 1100-1343). \"We could use it, but we could also get variety out of it, and even move the story forward by utilizing the different variants of this particular architectural style,\" Mosesian says.\n\nWhile their sources of inspiration were the cultural products and aesthetics created by real ancient empires, that's not to say that the in-game creations are a model of historical accuracy.\n\n\"There are no actual massive twin Ganesha statues anywhere in the world. But there is in our game world.\"\n\n\"There are no actual massive twin Ganesha statues anywhere in the world (that I'm aware of), but there is in our game world,\" Mosesian says.\n\n\"We take those artistic principles and apply them to whatever is it we're trying to do ... as long as there's consistency there, then generally speaking, the player will accept it as being plausible.\"\n\nThat trade off with reality also comes into play in another area of Uncharted games, as well: the decay and wearing of the ancient ruins that players explore. If everything was accurate to how the natural elements would interact with a structure, there might not be a whole lot left.\n\n\"It's good to have portions of a level that are accurately weathered,\" Mosesian says. \"But you have to throw a little bit of that out for the sake of the visuals.\"\n\n\"Mosesian recalls getting feedback after the first Uncharted from somebody who was angry that the metal bars in prison should have long ago eroded away.\"\n\nMosesian recalls seeing feedback after the first Uncharted from somebody who was angry that the metal bars in an ancient prison would have long ago eroded away.\n\n\"OK fine, that's fine, but then...how do we keep Drake in prison?\" Mosesian told them.\n\n\"It's those little things where you're like, some bizarre circumstance meant that this particular bar did not rust out, and you just kind of have to let go of those things and go with the suspension of disbelief,\" Mosesian says. \"Just play the game and have fun.\"\n\nBesides, he insists, \"everything starts looking the same after 1000 years.\"\n\nThe Lost Legacy \u2014 which is releasing roughly 15 months after Uncharted 4 \u2014 had \"little to no\" pre-production time, something that Mosesian claims was the project's biggest challenge. Another limiting decision, however, actually worked in The Lost Legacy's favor.\n\n\"It just doesn't feel right to throw old assets into a new game.\"\n\n\"One of the reasons why we were able to make this game to the same quality of Uncharted 4, and visually speaking, even a little bit better in some cases, was that we said there would be no new tech on this project,\" Moresain says.\n\nOne of the great things about DLC, from a developer's point of view, is that you don't have to reinvent the wheel. You can re-use technology, mechanics, locales, and characters that were created for the original title.\n\nBut the art team on The Lost Legacy didn't lean too heavily on recycled assets.\n\n\"We're crazy, we're nuts, so the majority of the stuff in The Lost Legacy is all made for this project,\" Mosesian says. \"It just doesn't feel right to throw old assets into a new game.\" The team did reuse some elements, including a lot of Uncharted 4's foliage library.

He decided that he would have to force humanity to evolve beyond its innately destructive tendencies by turning them into super mutants. In 2162, a person known to history only as the Vault Dweller destroyed the Master's mutant army by causing an explosion in the FEV vats at Mariposa, which collapsed the entire base, after which he proceeded to The Cathedral in the ruins of Los Angeles and killed the Master.\n\nIn 2236, the Enclave discovered the remnants of the Mariposa Base. Soon, Enclave assault squads combed the desert for slaves they could use to excavate the military base and get to the FEV vats. In 2237 the Enclave abandoned the site after mutations occurred among Enclave personnel and slaves exposed to the FEV remnants in the facility, causing a second generation of Mariposa super mutants to arise.\n\nBy 2281, some super mutants from both generations have established a community called the State of Utobitha in Black Mountain near New Vegas under the leadership of Tabitha. The smarter and more organized Master's Army remnants are in charge of the dumber second generation mutants. Some other, more peaceful mutants reside in Jacobstown, led by Marcus.\n\nCharacteristics Edit\n\nBiology Edit\n\nSuper mutants are mutated humans, products of infection by the Forced Evolutionary Virus (FEV). The super mutants found in the Mojave Wasteland are of the variety that originated from the Mariposa Military Base in California. They are much taller, bulkier and muscular than pure strain humans, have (mostly) green, gray, or yellowish skin, are immune to disease and radiation, and are gifted with superhuman strength and endurance. Although they are completely sterile, the rapid regeneration of their cells caused by FEV makes them biologically immortal (but not immune to death from injury).\n\nAverage super mutants stand approximately 10.4 feet tall (although they typically stand with hunched backs that reduce them to about 7.8 feet) and weigh around 800 pounds, possibly even more. Their skin is extremely tough, and their muscle and bone structure are enhanced well beyond the normal human genetics.\n\nSuper mutant intelligence varies greatly throughout super mutants. Though generally \"lacking\" in the mental aspect of life some super mutants retained some (if not all) of their intelligence from before they were changed into super mutants.\n\nGameplay attributes Edit\n\nSuper mutants often use heavy guns and melee weapons such as heavy incinerators and super sledges. The melee variants rush the player after throwing their frag grenades and the ranged mutants will shoot at the player from a distance while they slowly advance, relying on their armor for protection. Some super mutants will have centaurs to aid them.\n\nAll regular super mutants wear armor which gives them a Damage Threshold of 15, equal to a suit of combat armor. Nightkin do not have any armor, but benefit from an innate 30% Damage Resistance.\n\nVariants Edit\n\nSuper mutant Edit\n\nThe weakest of the three basic types of super mutant. These mutants attack by rushing the player if utilizing a melee weapon or standing in place shooting the player with a hunting rifle, relying on their superior health and armor for protection from attacks. Standard super mutants appear at lower levels, and will be replaced with brutes and masters at higher levels.\n\nSuper mutant brute Edit\n\nBrutes are the mainstay powerhouses of the super mutant forces. They are typically armed with assault carbines or incinerators for ranged combat, or sledgehammers and frag grenades for melee combat. They can be distinguished by their Trojan-like helmets and crude metal armor. A dead one can be found in the Ruby Hill Mine carrying various loot such as a multiplas rifle. Brutes appear at medium level, and will be replaced by Masters at high player levels.\n\nSuper mutant master Edit\n\nThe strongest mutant players will encounter. They use light machine guns or miniguns for long range combat and super sledges for close range. They are distinguished from the other two types because they wear a black suit of full body armor and some sort of optical augmentation on their left eye. Masters appear at high levels wherever super mutants normally appear. Masters in Jacobstown speak clearly and show more intelligence than the standard super mutants around them.\n\nNightkin Edit\n\nBlue mutants made from the most untainted humans, these dangerous creatures utilize Stealth Boys to sneak up on their victims. They often prefer melee weapons such as the super sledge, rebar clubs or the bumper sword though some can be seen using firearms. Their skin tone is deep purplish blue in color.\n\n"}

Here is how game three played out.\n\nAs expected, the fans in Nashville are into it as the puck gets dropped, however, the crowd is quickly silenced just 2:46 into the game as, who else, Jake Guentzel slides the puck under Rinne's pads and gives Pittsburgh a 1-0 lead.

The Guentzel goal would be the lone tally in the first period, so after 1 it was Penguins 1, Predators 0.\n\nThe second period started and Nashville came out like it was the last period of their season. They were absolutely flying around the ice, and the crowd loved it. Justin Schultz would take a minor penalty for holding, putting Nashville on the power play, and they took advantage.\n\nRoman Josi would fire a slap shot that would deflect off of the Penguins' defender and just go over Murray's pad.

The boarding was a minor penalty and gave Pittsburgh an opportunity to tie the game up. They could not capitalize on the chance and shortly after Nashville would strike again.\n\nWith less than 30 seconds to go in the second period, James Neal would find an opening on the left side of the net and bank the puck in off of an unsuspecting Murray. The goal once again sent the crowd into a frenzy and also gave Nashville a 3-1 lead.

Nashville's Craig Smith would take advantage of a gift wrapped break away chance after Chris Kunitz tried to deke around teammate Phil Kessel. The puck would deflect off of Kessel's skate, leading to the great chance for Smith. Bad luck for Pittsburgh, as Nashville would take a commanding 3 goal lead in the third period.

Rinne desperately needed to put on a good performance, as he had been the scapegoat for Predator fans so far in this series after the first two games.

But even he didn't seem to be under the illusion that it was nearly far enough.\n\n\"When we first came here, we knew very few people,\" Sanders said to a more than half-empty gymnasium Friday evening. \"But in the last nine months, we have come a very long way, and that's because of your support.\" Close video Clinton, Sanders both want big win in SC Hillary Clinton has the edge in South Carolina polling, but as Bernie Sanders proved in our Hardball College Tour, he's not giving up without a fight.

Polls suggest she's ahead by 25 percentage points, thanks to her disproportionate support among African-Americans. And the contest comes after Sanders failed to punch a hole in Clinton's so-called firewall in last week's Nevada caucuses.\n\n\"That goddamn firewall's got a crack in it,\" touted Killer Mike, the rapper who has become one of Sanders most prominent surrogates. But cracks don't bring down walls, and Sanders' path to the Democratic nomination is much murkier now than Clinton's. South Carolina could be the first in a combination punch, with Clinton hoping to to deliver a body blow next week on Super Tuesday.\n\nA few hours before Sanders spoke and less than a mile away, the Democratic front-runner took the stage in front of a mostly packed gymnasium at next-door South Carolina State. She was introduced by Rep. Jim Clyburn, the state's most powerful Democrat, and there was a section of local black and party leaders up front.\n\n\"I'm a proud defender of President Obama,\" Clinton declared to cheers for the man still revered by many voters here. \"I was honored to serve as his secretary of state. We became not just partners, but friends, and I'm not going to let the Republicans rip away the progress we have made under his leadership.\"\n\nThe only sign of trouble came from Rod Webber, a camera-wielding white man from Boston who loudly interrupted the event to protest Clinton's record. \"Hillary Clinton is not the person for the black men,\" Webber said as black men supporting Clinton urged him to leave the event.\n\nIt was a similar story when Clinton visited Claflin in November, shortly before Sanders visited South Carolina State. Her event was packed and nearly 100-percent black. She learned how to dance the wobble and posed for selfies with women who said they've been eager to vote for Hillary Clinton since she campaigned here for her husband in 1991.\n\n\"The hard part is getting beyond the Clinton brand.

When reporters puzzled why Sanders was investing so much time and money in a state where polls suggested he was bound to lose, aides said it was a demonstration that Sanders' message could resonate anywhere.\n\nMore recently, however, Sanders seemed to give up hope in South Carolina, focusing more on later contests.\n\nHis campaign hoped to narrow Clinton's lead to significantly less than 20 percentage points, both to score some delegates here and to show Sanders could win over African-American voters.\n\nAnd indeed, there were signs of progress in the dozens of young black voters who came to see Sanders. \"He's thinking the same things that I'm thinking,\" said Ah"}

But many of those job-seekers aren't willing to tackle the tough, low- wage, long-hour farm labor.\n\n\"They miss a lot of work. They come when they want to come. They get bored,\" said Mario Moreno, a crew leader for Talbott.\n\nThe voluminous regulations attached to bringing in H-2A guest agricultural workers require that employers exhaust all attempts to hire Americans before giving jobs to foreign workers.\n\nEmployers say the H-2A workers are willing to work the long hours and, as their visas require, will stick with the job until after the harvest. Those workers also don't want to jeopardize pay that at the end of one day in the orchards adds up to a week's pay in Mexico.\n\nMany have agriculture experience. And many return to the same U.S. farms year after year, which means they can do the work without much oversight.\n\n\"I'm doing my level best to support the local economy, but it's tough,\" said Theresa High, who operates High Country Orchards, down the road from Talbott.\n\nHigh Country has had similar trouble with local workers leaving jobs once they realize picking fruit for long hours is not the fun they had envisioned.\n\nDuring boom times, locals often don't bother to look to the orchards and farm fields for jobs. But when construction and energy-drilling jobs went away, the unemployed began to consider unskilled farm work that generally pays about $8 an hour.\n\nBill Thoennes, a spokesman for the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment, said employers must walk a fine line when they spell out the difficulties of the work without seeming to intimate that they don't want to hire local workers.\n\nJohn Harold of Tuxedo Corn in Olathe said he gets few local applicants because word has gotten around that his work days begin at 6 a.m.\n\n\"It's amazing how few have applied this year,\" he said.\n\n\"A big challenge\"\n\nAt Talbott, the largest fruit operation in the Grand Valley, hundreds of job-seekers asked about employment this year and last. This spring, only 15 of the workers sent out by the Mesa County Workforce Center submitted applications.\n\nNine showed up for work. Four of those were gone after a week. One remains on the crew, and he is missing work this day because he was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving the previous night.\n\n\"It's a big challenge. Almost all of them have a background that makes them difficult to employ,\" said Bruce Talbott as he pulled out a slip of paper where he had tallied the hours put in by domestic hires compared with the H-2A workers.\n\nThe locals worked 37 to 55 hours a week while the H-2A workers were in the orchards for about 70 hours.\n\nTalbott said some of the locals are hard workers, \"but they have never seen a fruit tree before.\"\n\nHe said because he has seen desperation in their eyes this year, he tries to hire them despite the challenges. In doing so, he runs the risk of not having enough workers at harvest time. If his American workers quit, it will be too late to apply for more H-2A workers.\n\nA requirement that employers anticipate the shortage of local workers and apply for H-2A workers at least 45 days before the workers are needed is just one of the complications of the guest-worker program.\n\nThe jobs must be advertised in newspapers and on radio stations and posted at job service centers. Employers must hire local workers if they are \"able, willing, qualified and available.\"\n\nDecline in requests\n\nVoluminous record-keeping is required for every step.\n\nThe H-2A rules changed in mid- March under the Obama administration to raise wages and call for mandatory inspections of housing. Farmworker rights groups are applauding the changes as being more protective of workers. For many growers, the regulations are more costly and cumbersome.\n\nThe combination of more available domestic workers and H-2A rules has resulted in a decline in requests for the workers in Colorado.\n\nIn 2008, Colorado growers put in 153 applications for nearly 2,000 guest workers. This year, 96 growers have asked for 1,036 guest workers.\n\nStill, Moreno said, the guest workers do the bulk of the jobs in the orchards.\n\n\"They do the work,\" he said. \"The others"}

He hit 7 of his 8 shots, including 4 of 5 from three-point land, en route to 22 first-half points \u2014 the most points scored by any Stanford player in a half this season. The Cardinal topped the 80-point mark for the first time in Pac-12 play.\n\n\"I felt like I just had it going,\" Pickens said. \"I wanted to come out in the first half aggressively, especially when Rosco went out with his two quick fouls. We knew as a team we had to pick up the slack offensively for sure.\"\n\nStanford's defense, the team's bread and butter in conference play, was able to hold USC to 64 points despite the Trojans coming in averaging 82.4 points per game. The Trojans' starting backcourt of Jordan McLaughlin and Julian Jacobs were held to 5 total points on a combined 2-11 from the field.\n\nDawkins credits his team's intensity from the get-go for Stanford's first-half success.\n\n\"I thought we just got off to a very good start to today's game. I thought our guys did a really good job right from the tip,\" he said. \"There was a really good focus, especially on the defensive end. Guys were really active, and I think that got us off to a good start.\"\n\nSophomore Michael Humphrey played a big role in anchoring the Cardinal defense. Humphrey stood strong in the face of the Trojans' penetration and looked comfortable in the paint after struggling with a thigh injury in recent games. Despite having no points in the first half, Humphrey finished with 10 points, 6 rebounds and 3 blocks.\n\nUSC struggled to get the ball in the hoop in the opening period. After netting 14 points in the first eight minutes, the Trojans managed only 11 more through the remainder of the half. Meanwhile, Stanford ripped off a 30-11 run behind Pickens' hot shooting.\n\nThe Cardinal were up 20 with two minutes left before half when USC scored five quick points. Pickens was rolling, however, and drew a foul from behind the arc with less than one tick left on the clock. He would go on to sink all three free throws.\n\nThe Trojans once again made a run in the second half but failed to pull out a victory as Rosco Allen dashed any hopes of a USC comeback. A Bennie Boatwright three sliced the Stanford lead to 12, but Stanford countered with Allen, who sank a three of his own in the first possession after checking back into the game with seven minutes remaining. Stanford would expand its lead to as high as 26 before coasting towards a win.\n\nAllen tallied 17 points on the night after being held scoreless in five minutes of play in the first half.\n\nStanford is now one win away from pulling up to .500 in the Pac-12. The Cardinal have three games left on their slate, hosting UCLA (15-13, 6-9) next on Saturday.\n\nUCLA is already in the Bay, having lost to Cal 75-63 on Thursday night. After a promising start to the season, including wins over then-No. 1 Kentucky and No. 20 Gonzaga, the Bruins have struggled in conference play, losing six of their last nine to drop to 10th in the conference.\n\nUCLA is led by its strong backcourt, made up of junior guards Isaac Hamilton and Bryce Alford, who average 17 and 16.1 points per game respectively, and who together account for more than half of the team's assists. Hamilton has been particularly potent offensively, shooting .497 from the field and over 40 percent from downtown.\n\nStanford, currently on the bubble to make the NIT, will look to finish strong in order to lock up a spot in the tournament. Finishing the season with a couple of wins will also be crucial for the team in order to improve their Pac-12 standing for the conference tournament in early March.\n\nTip-off against the Bruins is at 1:30 p.m. on Saturday at Maples Pavilion.\n\nContact Irving Rodriguez at irodriguez 'at' stanford.edu."}

(AP Photo/Lefteris Pitarakis)\n\nA core principle of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is that member states adhere to democratic values . So what happens now that Turkey, a longtime NATO member, has suspended a number of legal protections in the weeks and months following the July 15 coup attempt?\n\nImmediately after part of the military tried to overthrow his government, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan retaliated with a widespread purge of large numbers of police officers, judges and soldiers. By late July, the Turkish government's crackdown had extended to the private financial sector , as well as the country's universities. The government detained as many as 50,000 in what one news report called \"the biggest purge in Turkey's modern history.\"\n\n[How Erdogan's anti-democratic government made Turkey ripe for unrest]\n\nTurkey's ties with the West are strained\n\nAs discussed here in the Monkey Cage, Erdogan met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in early August after criticizing the U.S.-European response to the coup. That Erdogan sought closer ties with Putin is a remarkable outcome in light of the fact that Turkey and Russia have been at loggerheads over Syria.\n\nFrom Turkey's perspective, NATO and the West may have \"failed the solidarity test\" by offering Erdogan little reassurance after the coup attempt. Washington, for instance, made no promise to grant Turkey's extradition request for Fethullah Gulen, the U.S.-based Turkish cleric who Erdogan claims was the coup's mastermind. AWhile the two nations have been cooperating in the ongoing fight against the Islamic State, significant tensions remain.\n\n[Why it's good for dictators to have dictator friends]\n\nThese recent developments \u2014 and years of creeping authoritarianism by Erdogan and his AKP party \u2014 have led some foreign policy analysts to call for Turkey's expulsion from NATO.\n\nDoug Bandow at the Cato Institute called for a \"civil divorce,\" noting that \"As Ankara moves toward an authoritarian one-party state, its membership in NATO becomes ever more incongruous.\"\n\nAnother Cato scholar, Ted Galen Carpenter, last year wrote that \"NATO is supposed to be an alliance of peaceful democracies. Yet evidence continues to mount that Turkey fails to meet [that] standard.\" More recently, Carpenter wrote, \"Does America really want to risk its security to protect such allies, especially when it purports to lead an alliance of enlightened democracies?\"\n\n[Here's why there are so many conspiracy theories about the Turkish coup]\n\nBut Erdogan's increasingly authoritarian stance doesn't necessarily provide the grounds for booting Turkey out of NATO. A brief look at the historical record shows that the United States has a long and complicated legacy of supporting autocrats both inside and outside of NATO.\n\nThere are many examples in U.S. history\n\nMichael Poznansky's research with John Owen suggests that as a general rule, the United States is far less likely to dump a dictator if there is a credible ideological alternative to liberal democracy and capitalism that opponents might institute \u2014 if given the chance to govern.\n\nIn 1961, for example, President John F. Kennedy summarized what he saw as three U.S. options regarding the longtime Dominican Republic dictator Rafael Trujillo: \"In descending order of preference: a decent democratic regime, a continuation of the Trujillo regime or a Castro regime. We ought to aim at the first, but we really can't renounce the second until we are sure that we can avoid the third.\"\n\nWhen communist forces emerged as viable competitors in some countries in the late 1970s, Jimmy Carter \u2014 perhaps the most dovish president during the Cold War \u2014 turned a blind eye to Ferdinand Marcos's electoral fraud in the Philippines (1978) and Chun Doo Hwan's crackdown on student protesters in South Korea (1980).\n\nNATO allies don't always play by the rules\n\nThat's what history shows, but what about the supporting data as it pertains specifically to NATO allies? We decided to compare Turkey and Portugal, a NATO founding member in 1949 that didn't become a full democracy until 1976. Turkey, which joined the alliance in 1952, has fluctuated between full-fledged democracy and a regime with strong authoritarian characteristics (the same is true of Greece, which also joined the alliance in 1952).\n\nThe two graphs below chart the fluctuations in regime type for Portugal and Turkey from the year each entered the alliance through 2013. We coded each country's \"polity score\" using the Polity IV index. Scores ranged from -10 (most autocratic) to +10 (most democratic). The horizontal red line represents a score of +7 on the Polity index \u2014 this is the threshold political scientists commonly use to gauge whether a country is a mature and stable democracy.\n\nThese graphs clearly show that both Portugal and Turkey have, at various times, fallen far short of this threshold."}
{"id": 259911, "ended": true, "length": 668, "text": "In the 62nd minute of Minnesota United's 3-2 loss at Toronto FC on Saturday, Kevin Molino stepped up and took a terrible penalty kick that rolled right into the arm of Toronto goalkeeper Alexander Bono.\n\nBut here's what makes Molino worthy of United's big-money transaction that brought him to the MLS expansion team this offseason: He strolled right back up to the blocked ball and coolly slotted home the rebound.\n\nThat goal was Molino's second of the match and the second time he started the Loons' ultimately unsuccessful comeback. Several other attacking players had golden opportunities to score, including rookie Abu Danladi in the first half and substitute Johan Venegas late in the second. Only Molino capitalized.\n\nThe Trinidad and Tobago native has started and played 10 matches for United, missing one because of national team duty. He has five goals and three assists this season. But before the Toronto match, his last goal was in a 4-2 victory over Salt Lake on April 1, and his last assist was in a 2-2 draw at Houston on April 15.\n\nThe reason for Molino's sudden uptick in offense might have a bit to do with a lineup adjustment. Molino has played mostly on the right wing this season. But against Toronto, he played more centrally in a playmaking position. Danladi took his spot on the right.\n\n\"We put him underneath \u2026 to try to get him a bit more involved in the game and to try and see if he can link up with Ibson,\" coach Adrian Heath said. \"We've got the two midfield players [who] are both very good first touch, and they can find the little pockets of space in behind. And that's when Kevin's at his best. So I just wanted to see if we could get him on the ball a little bit more \u2026 and I thought we did a little bit.\"\n\nMolino\n\nMolino, though, isn't one to wax poetic about his two goals Saturday. Instead, he lamented the wasted chance of bringing the momentum of a big victory against one of the league's top teams into Sunday's matchup with the LA Galaxy at TCF Bank Stadium.\n\n\"Most important, the game is a team sport, and we all want to go home happy together, collectively, with three points,\" Molino said in a team news release. \"The two goals are good to keep my confidence up, and I look forward to the next game against the LA Galaxy.\"\n\nHeath said the challenge with Molino is just to give him opportunities. Because as the penalty-kick-gone-wrong-turned-right evidenced, Molino won't squander them.\n\n\"He's a quality footballer,\" Heath said. \"I expected before this season started, he'd get double figures in both categories [goals and assists]. So if he stays healthy, he'll get his 12 to 13 goals.\n\n\"But more importantly, we need to keep him involved in the game because that's the hardest thing with football, to score and make goals. So the more we can keep him active and in and around the game and the ball, the better he's going to be.\""}

It can only be purchased by Counter-Terrorists on bomb defusal maps. It halves the time required to defuse the bomb (five seconds instead of the usual ten). It is automatically used when defusing the bomb and can be used an unlimited amount of times.\n\nPossessing the defuse kit adds a symbol of a pair of pliers to the player's HUD under the player's inventory. In Source and Global Offensive, when playing as a Counter-Terrorist or as a spectator, the scoreboard shows a defuser icon next to the name of the player for players possessing a defuse kit.\n\nIn Global Offensive, the defusal kit is given to all CT players for free in Casual Bomb Scenario at the start of a round. It still needs to be purchased in Competitive Bomb Scenario.\n\nIf a Counter-Terrorist dies, their Defuse Kit will be dropped, and other Counter-Terrorist without a Defuse Kit can pick it up. Interestingly, if a CT begins defusing the bomb and had somehow picked up a defusal kit at the same time, the C4 will still require 10 seconds to defuse and not 5. This can be done by jumping on the C4, begin the defusal process, and then obtaining the defusal kit. However, if the defusal process is restarted when following the aforementioned fact, the bomb can be defused in 5 seconds.\n\nIt is often highly recommended to purchase a kit as a Counter-Terrorist to reduce the time it takes to defuse (this is especially helpful when \"ninja\" defusing). If a team is tighter on economy, then it is also viable to only have two players purchase defuse kits, one stationed at each bombsite to defuse the bomb when the site is clear, or let others pick up their kits to defuse if they die.\n\nThe Defusal kit is the standard equipment in Deleted Scenes. The player will automatically use it when defusing a bomb, and the defuse time is same as in multiplayer (5 seconds). However, the suitcase Nuke and sometimes bombs can also be defused like the C4 but slower and the time needed to defuse is same as defusing C4 without a kit (10 seconds).\n\nIn the Counter-Strike: Condition Zero Tour of Duty campaign, the CT bots will never buy a defuse kit. However, they will pick it up if a defusal kit is dropped in their pathways.\n\nAchievements\n\nBomb Combat Ready\n\nDefuse a bomb with a kit when it would have failed without one. Unknown Combat Ready\n\nDefuse a bomb with a kit when it would have failed without one.\n\nUnreleased\n\nBugs\n\nRarely in Counter-Strike and Condition Zero, the buy menu can become buggy, showing the item available to terrorists. However, trying to purchase the defuse kit as a terrorist will display the message, \"The 'Bomb defuse kit' is not available in your team to buy.\"[1] This may be more common if the player has custom options of loadout.\n\nTrivia\n\nThis equipment is referred to as defuser in game files.\n\nin game files.

Since my neighbors have been driving me crazy and no amount of civilized reasoning and/or negotiations have worked - I have decided to dedicate a small corner of cyber-space to them.\n\nMy family and friends are constantly asking me to tell them the \"latest\" thing my neighbor has done so this page will save me from repeating myself. Besides, I thought it would be fun. Everything you read here is entirely true, that's what makes it so funny. Enjoy!\n\nBackground:\n\nMy neighbors moved into the house next to ours in October 1997. It's a brand new neighborhood with new houses. Everyone's house looks beautiful but that's about to change. The new neighbors seem like normal people until shortly after they move in (more later).\n\nFirst, let me say that my redneck neighbor is not destitute or under-privileged. The guy owns a business, drives VERY nice new cars, he just doesn't care about his house. In order to protect the ignorant, we'll call him John Doe # 8 or JD8 for short.\n\nOctober 1997 - They are here!\n\nWell, it should have been a sign of things to come but my neighbors move into their brand new house. Inventory: 1 artificial Christmas tree, clothes, stereo system, TV, no furniture). The Christmas tree is nicely decorated (remember, it's October). We can tell what the tree looks like because the windows have no miniblinds so at night, you can see right into the house as you drive up. They have also decided to wrap some strands of Christmas lights around their front porch railing. I guess there's no electric outlet nearby because they never turn these lights on.\n\nOctober 1997 - 1st Home beautification project\n\nIt's dark outside, I'm standing in front of my house and my neighbor does the following: He gets in his car, drives it up to the house on the other side of my house (this house is still being built). He backs his car up to the construction site and opens the trunk. He calmly proceeds to load up the trunk with bricks and 2x4s. Pretty clever, huh?\n\nThe following night, at around 9:00pm he decides it's time to build a mailbox post. It's very nice. He used the stolen 2x4s from the previous night. It looks like it's made out of 2x4s except he didn't steal any that were long enough so he nails a couple of them together to get the correct height - I mean, it has to look just right! The mailbox post is not very sturdy so he braces it with an additional 2x4 (at an angle). Click here to see the mailbox (no bracing 2x4 though).\n\nHe uses the bricks as edging for his flower beds. They look nice. Especially with the newly planted bamboo trees and the ten gallon fish tank (no fish, just water).\n\nNovember 1997 - The fence!\n\nI wake up to my wife telling me, \"Hey, it looks like JD8 is working on a fence\". Well I don't think much of it until she tells me that he's trying to build a fence around the entire house (front and back) and that the fence is going to be chain-link. We have some \"covenant rules\" that prohibit you from putting up a silver chain-link fence. Also, you cannot have any fence go past the back of your house. By now, I am freaking out. I can see the property value falling faster than his mailbox post.\n\nAnyway, I get to work and at 9:01AM I call our builder. I explain the situation to him and he agrees to pay JD8 a visit before the concrete around the metal posts dries. Sure enough, I get home after work and the posts around the front of the house are laying on the street. Not exactly what I expected but at least they're out of the ground. Tragedy is averted for now.\n\nA few days later I realize he's not putting up chain-link but \"chicken wire\". Call # 2 to the builder. While talking on the phone, the builder starts referring to the neighbor in a less-than-amicable fashion \u2013 someone else on my side!\n\nBy that afternoon, the fence is chain-link again. The top of the fence looks like a wave (he didn't want to spend the 6 bucks on a level), and the sides look like an S. Very crafty guy. Total estimated fence cost: $250.00 - but wait! -- He didn't set all the metal posts in concrete! Actual cost: $62.50. You get the idea here.\n\nSometime after the fence\n\nWell, it's time to give Cujo"}

Their over-matched head coach Joe Philbin was fired after an embarrassing loss in Europe to the rival NY Jets which put them in a 1-3 hole early.\n\nThe move seemed to light a fire, at least temporarily, as they beat their next two opponents by a combined 82-36. It was mostly downhill from there though as the Dolphins have now gone seven seasons without a playoff berth and 15 without a playoff win. Coincidentally that was just one year after the great Dan Marino decided to hang-up his cleats in Miami. And that's just about how long Miami fans have been searching for a franchise player to be proud of.\n\nCURRENT\n\nWhile Miami fans continue to wait for that franchise player, they are also growing tired of waiting for a coach capable of leading them to respectability on the sidelines.\n\nWhen the great Don Shula left after the '95 season, Jimmy Johnson returned to his roots in an attempt to re-energize the franchise. JJ did take the Dolphins to the post-season in three of his four seasons, but he could never quite recapture that championship magic from his days in Dallas or in Miami with the Hurricanes. When Johnson retired, Miami fans could probably never have imagined how bad things were about to get.\n\nAll these years later and not since Nick Saban was hired in '05 has the base been this excited about the possibilities with the hiring of Adam Gase.\n\nGase, a former offensive coordinator, has looked the part recently with both Chicago and Denver, but Jay Cutler and Peyton Manning were already proven quarterbacks by the time he took over. Also, don't forget that Philbin looked ready for primetime as the offensive coordinator for Green Bay when the Packers won their most recent Super Bowl in 2010. Philbin coached another proven quarterback in Aaron Rodgers. My point is that just because a coach can look good as part of a staff with Hall Of Fame QBs like Manning and Rodgers doesn't mean he'll be great as the leader of one with Ryan Tannehill.\n\nThe top priority for Gase will be to get his $100 million dollar quarterback to earn every dollar. If Gase can work magic with Tannehill then the rest of the pieces are in place for a playoff season. The Dolphins have some young exciting skill position players including WR Jarvis Landry. But the next step is to scare the opposition with a credible deep passing attack which has sorely lacked under Tannehill. The Mike Wallace experiment failed so it's up to second-year WR DeVante Parker and promising rookie WR Leonte Carroo to open up the field. Parker averaged 19 yards on his 26 receptions as a rookie while Carroo averaged over 19.5 yards on his 122 receptions during his college career at Rutgers.\n\nThe running game must also take up some slack with Lamar Miller departing for Houston. Miami is gambling on injury-prone players in second-year back Jay Ajayi and free agent acquisition Arian Foster. Ajayi rushed for over 3,700 yards with 50 TDs in college but missed his first seven games last year with a preseason rib injury. He also tore his ACL in 2011 and injured his knee just last week. Foster of course missed most of last season with a torn ACL in Houston.\n\nOn defense, the return of Cameron Wake from a season-ending Achilles injury will be crucial. If Wake returns close to form along with newly acquired free agent defensive end Mario Williams on the outside and the elite Ndamukong Suh on the inside, Miami will have a formidable unit up-front.\n\nFormer first-round pick Dion Jordan also returns from a one-year suspension. If the Dolphins can get anything out of Jordan, even if it comes mostly on special teams where he came up big on several occasions in 2014, Miami will be much better off.\n\nI know we're beating a dead horse here, but the health of MLB Kiko Alonso is also critical to the success of their defense. Alonso looked like a future NFL star after a great rookie season before multiple knee injuries derailed his time in Buffalo and Philadelphia. This season could define both his pro career and the playoff hopes for Miami.\n\nThe secondary has big questions at cornerback, but the safety duo of Reshad Jones and newly acquired free agent Isa Abdul-Quddus will be one of the most underrated in the league.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIf rookie first-round pick Laremy Tunsil can be the difference-maker that the offensive line desperately needs inside at guard and QB Ryan Tannehill has his breakout season under"}

Madrid\n\nToday is the 200th anniversary of the battle of Waterloo, which put an end to the French Revolution and to Napoleon Bonaparte's imperial dreams. The Spanish diplomatic and military history has forgotten about one of its heroes of the Peninsular War, who played a determinant role in that battle.\n\nIt is the General Miguel Ricardo de \u00c1lava (Vitoria, 1772\u2013Bar\u00e8ges, France, 1843), who held, on several occasions, the position of Spanish Ambassador to England (twice), France (twice) and the Netherlands.\n\n\u00c1lava has the honour of being the only Spanish officer to have participated in the battles of Trafalgar and Waterloo, the most important ones of his time. He fought the first one \u2013and lost\u2013 against the English of Admiral Nelson. He fought the second one in Belgian land against the French and along his friend Sir Arthur Wellesley, the Duke of Wellington.\n\n\u00c1lava was ambassador of Ferdinand VII to the Netherlands, with headquarters in Brussels, when Napoleon fled from the island of Elba and returned to the metropolis victorious. By order of the monarch, he integrated into the General Staff of Wellington in which, at the end of the day, would be the only Spanish contribution to the so-called Seventh Coalition created against the French Emperor.\n\nThere is a lot of documentation, most of it British, indicating \u00c1lava's presence with Wellington the night prior to the battle (from 17 to 18 June 1815), as well as during it and, when everything was over, having dinner on their own at the inn Jean de Nivelles of Waterloo, according to the book '\u00c1lava en Waterloo' by Ildefonso Arenas.\n\nGeneral \u00c1lava was Spanish Ambassador to England, France and the Netherlands\n\nSubsequently, this general was ambassador to France (1815 and 1835), deputy for \u00c1lava (1821), president of the Parliament (1822), ambassador to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1834 and 1838), senator (1834 and 1836), minister of the Navy (1835) and president of the Cabinet for a few days (1835).\n\nDuring the Maria Christina's regency, he was ambassador to London, where he tried to manage the intervention of the Quadruple Alliance firmly and with economic and military support during the Carlist Wars in favour of the Queen Isabella II. However, his determination did not bear fruit.\n\nFinally, and not being very happy about it, he accepted to be ambassador to Paris, where he presented a plan for the Christian troops to cross to France in their fight against Carlism, to refuel in the neighbouring country and to stop the supplies getting to Carlists. In London's Embassy again, he returned to Spain, being already very sick, in June 1843 and died within a month on one of his trips to the south of France to take therapeutic baths."}
{"id": 259928, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "TIBET PERMIT UPDATE 2012\n\nSEEKING TRAVEL COMPANIONS OR TREK PARTNERS?\n\nPlease post only on our Travel Companions branch, not here.\n\n\nTopics posted on the Tibet, Mongolia etc. branch will be moved by the moderators to the Travel Companions branch without notice.\n\nIf you also have a travel question then please post it as a separate topic on the appropriate travel branch.\n\nThis thread is about travel to the Tibet Autonomous Region (T.A.R.). This thread does not include information about Tibetan areas outside of T.A.R. For questions, about non-TAR Tibetan areas please search the TT and/or start a new thread.\n\nFor travelers wishing to travel to the Tibet Autonomous Region a permit is required along with your normal Chinese visa. This permit is checked by officials when boarding any flights to Lhasa, any trains to Lhasa and of course, at the land border crossing with Nepal (Friendship Hwy - Dram/Zangmu/Kodari).\n\nSince 2008 the political situation in the region has deteriorated dramatically, and it is virtually impossible to travel independently as it was prior to 2008. Permits cannot be purchased separately from any source and must be procured through a registered travel agent. The travel agent is required by Chinese law to provide a local certified guide for the entire time you are in the T.A.R. There is currently no way around this rule.\n\nForeigners cannot travel on public transport in the T.A.R and local inhabitants are put at significant risk if travelers ask them for help in bypassing these rules.\n\nSince 2008 the Chinese government has closed the T.A.R. during sensitive political anniversaries or when any large protests or unrest occurs. The most sensitive period is around March 10th to 14th - the anniversary of the Tibetan uprising in 1959 and the riots in 2008. The government bans the tourism bureau from issuing permits to travel agents during these \"closure\" periods. This year, 2012, the T.A.R has been closed since early February and is likely to open again in late March or early April.\n\nIt must be understood that these closures are based on the government's assessment of the political and security situation. There is no official reopening date given in advance, so unfortunately for travelers, it is very difficult to plan travel in Tibet during March or even early April. It is unlikely there will be more closures during 2012 \u2013 but this cannot be guaranteed by anyone. It is important to understand that there are always rumours flying about when closures may or may not happen \u2013 but in the end nobody knows exactly until the Tourism Bureau either stops or starts issuing permits.\n\nA quick google search of \"Tibet News\" will usually give a range of news information and analysis relating to current unrest and protests in Tibetan areas.\n\nSo for first timers to planning a trip to Tibet here are some key things to consider when planning your time in Tibet: 1. There is no visa specific for Tibet. Travelers require a normal Chinese visa to enter Mainland China and in addition, a Tibet entry permit issued through a travel agent from the Tibet Tourism Bureau in Lhasa. Other permits may also be required for travel within the T.A.R. (also issued through your travel agent)\n\nIf entering Tibet from Nepal, you are required to have a \"Group Visa\" which is a document combining a Chinese visa and Tibet Permit. This Visa is only valid for the duration of your itinerary submitted to your travel agent plus two weeks, usually 21-28 days total and the time starts from the moment that you enter Tibet. It is difficult or impossible to extend this type of visa. It is difficult to impossible to leave the group and travel independently in China after your time in Tibet unless you specifically arrange for a separate \"individual\" group visa prior to the issuing of the visa.\n\n\nDo NOT get a standard Chinese visa prior to arrival in Nepal as the Chinese consulate in Kathmandu will cancel it in order to issue your group visa.\n\nMany people think they have to join a group tour to travel in Tibet. This is not true. You can negotiate with a travel agent for any level of service and any size \"group\". However, you must travel with a guide and the high cost of travel on the Tibetan plateau means that if you are a budget traveler, you'll most likely have to join or form a group to keep expenses within your budget. Permits are not issued instantly. It takes a day or two for the Tibet Tourism Bureau to issue the document. Since the original permit often is required to travel to Tibet, you need to plan in advance to receive the permit before you board the train or plane to Tibet.\n\nThese two websites often have up to date and detailed Tibet Travel information: www.cafespinn.com/en/tibet\n\n\nkekexili.typepad.com/"}

{"id": 259933, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "How could it be that so many houses appear to be empty, without neighbours waving hello, or mowing their lawns, or holding block parties, or giving out candy at Halloween? How could so many people be wrong?\n\nThe response to the city-commissioned study on empty housing was predictably immediate. Some media were quick to use the report's low numbers as proof that speculative buying with foreign money was a myth.\n\nThe study, which was intended to finally illuminate both city hall and residents on the extent of empty housing in Vancouver, was anti-climactic, to say the least. It reported that a mere one per cent of single-family homes were empty, a figure that hasn't budged much since 2002. The overall vacancy rate was at 4.8 per cent. Only condo vacancies raised an eyebrow, at around 10,000 units. So what happened?\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe answer to that question is far more nuanced than the report's use of BC Hydro electricity data can provide. The author of the study, Bruce Townson, is frank about the study's limitations \u2013 and there are several.\n\nHouses that had the electricity turned off \u2013 such as old houses that sit empty as they await permits for demolition and redevelopment \u2013 were not counted in the study. They were only counted after electrical service had been restored for a full year. In this market, there have been many cases of homes sitting empty, without electricity, awaiting redevelopment. Considering that there are 950 house demolition permits taken out on average each year, that's potentially a high number of houses that didn't make the cut. Many newly built houses were also exempt. They too were only considered empty once the electricity was turned on, and remained on, for one year.\n\nHouses that only have visitors during summer months were counted as occupied. Houses that sit empty but have a caretaker come by and generate electricity use at least five times a month were also considered occupied. And a house with the lights on timers and a housekeeper or maintenance person who comes by and uses the electricity, were also counted as lived in.\n\n\"If you have timers on at the same time, day to day, but then Jerry comes in and introduces a load every Monday and Wednesday each week and introduces high electricity use for a couple of hours on those days, and leaves, then that would be occupied, based on the data we have,\" said Mr. Townson.\n\nAs well, the study did not include data from 2015, which was a record year for Vancouver real estate. From January, 2015 to January, 2016, the average house price soared 46 per cent, all the way up to $2.87-million. In Vancouver proper, the benchmark price for a detached house hit a record $1.94-million in January, or a 26-per-cent gain from a year earlier.\n\n\"This is not out of design; this is out of the limitation of data,\" says Mr. Townson.\n\nMr. Townson says the report needs context, and further research is required. It is by no means intended as a comprehensive study on the uses of housing, or an explanation for Vancouver's affordability problem.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"When you look at it through the lens of what the city of Vancouver is trying to do, they are trying to address affordability \u2013 low vacancy rates \u2013 and you have to look at long-term non-occupancy, not short-term stuff.\"\n\nCouncillor Kerry Jang says the chief concern was to find out if houses were empty for a year at a time. He says the report is proof that foreign buyers are not hiding their money in houses and leaving them to fall into disrepair. He has no issues with a homeowner who only uses a house for a week or two out of the year, or a couple of months.\n\n\"It goes back to the fact that they assume an Asian investor is parking his money in Vancouver, leaving their house empty. That's what I'm taking issue with here. It's your property. If you want to live in it half the year, that's your business. Are you to tell me I have to live in my house for eight months of the year? What happens if I don't? Are you going to take it away from me? That's the argument.\"\n\nPoint Grey MLA David Eby, who's raised the issue of empty houses in the media, says he was shocked at both the survey results, and also the media reaction, which tied the results to proof that foreign investment was a \"myth.\" He calls the methodology \"conservative.\"\n\n\"We have a shocking number of empty condos and a huge number of underused homes. The people who are trying to sell this [myth] line should spend a little time in Point Grey, in Kerrisdale, and they will see the reality for themselves, in the stores and on"}
{"id": 259934, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "After two and a half weeks of action it all comes down to this. One game to lift the Nikolai Semashko Trophy. Slovenia is looking to make history on multiple levels while Serbia is looking to go that one step further after losses in major finals in 2009, 2014, and 2016. 40 minutes will decide the champions of EuroBasket 2017. In the final part of our three part preview of the EuroBasket 2017 final, Emmet Ryan breaks down the key battles that will decide the game\n\nYou have to go quite the way back to find perfection at EuroBasket. The road to the title usually comes with battle scars along the way. Lithuania was the last team to lift the trophy without defeat, going 6-0 in a condensed format in 2003. You have to go all the way back to 1995, when Yugoslavia went 9-0, for a side to have achieved what Slovenia is aiming for on Sunday night. The scars define the battle so often in this competition but it's been Slovenia's ability to resist the slings and arrows of outrageous competition that has defined this tournament.\n\n\nSerbia, they have taken their licks and look stronger for it. After a smooth start against Latvia they fell to Russia and might have to Turkey but they found their identity in their rally. The road has been rocky and not all that convincing at times but Serbia has remained resolute under the leadership of Bogdan Bogdanovic and the power of Boban Marjanovic. Now, the records mean nothing. They just need to get it together for one night to be crowned kings of Europe.\n\nI've selected three key battles that will prove crucial in this clash.\n\nDragic and Doncic vs Jovic and Bogdanovic\n\nGoran Dragic has been the man to keep Slovenia cool throughout this tournament while Luka Doncic is the ball of fire that has become the competition's runaway breakout star. Bogdan is Bogdan. That leaves Stefan Jovic as the X factor in this battle. In the simplest terms, he needs to have the game of his life. Against Russia, he was having a magnificent game albeit a quiet one to the casual observer before an ankle injury ruled him out for the closing stages.\n\nJovic is used to having to shoulder responsibility against superior rosters, being the point guard for Crvena Zvezda gets you more than used to that job. Defensively he has been on form throughout the competition and his offensive game has been coming together through the knockout stages. Against Slovenia's big two, it simply has to be on another level.\n\nFor our analysis series The Ballin After, post-game interviews, and more, subscribe to BallinEurope's YouTube channel\n\nThe Boban plan\n\nThere's one obvious area where Slovenia simply don't match up well with Serbia. Gasper Vidmar showed he could live with the Gasol brothers against Spain but a straight match-up against Boban Marjanovic is a risky venture with the title on the line. Marjanovic has size, strength, and a tendency to score a bunch. We all know what Slovenia will be expected to do, run hard on multiple consecutvie possessions to take the wind out of the big man, it's how they deploy this and how Serbia looks to counter that will matter.\n\nSasa Djordjevic won't just let Slovenia run his big man down. He's got Ognjen Kuzmic there to log big minutes defensively and any involvement of Vladimir Stimac, who has hardly seen the floor since the action switched to the Sinan Erdem Dome, could be crucial. Djordjevic is going to need to prioritise efficiency on Marjanovic possessions, he got plenty out of him on that front against Russia but he's going to need the unit to work around the big man to not let him get gassed. For Slovenia it's a matter of making life way too hard for Serbia on that front, with creative deployment of Anthony Randolp. The tougher they make it to keep Boban fresh, the better their chances.\n\nBallinEurope now has merch, like actual merch, t-shirts, phone covers, and even pillows. Check it all out on our RedBubble page.\n\nBattle of the benches\n\nIgor Kokoskov has been able to count on his bench from the off in this competition, giving his go to guys options to work with in every outing. It's not been as easy for Djordjevic but we've seen glimpses of the national team version of Milan Macvan, always far better than at club level, and Vladimir Lucic has had moments where he could be a difference maker.\n\nThis one again is really simple, Serbia has to get at least par with Slovenia in terms of bench contributions. It's a monster ask but the job is clear. Slovenia has unheralded players who can deliver strong stretches for their side. Serbia's lesser known batt"}

The money is handed out annually as part of emergency allocations, and covers storms from 2015, as well as cleanup from previous years where claims are still being settled. Money is used primarily to rebuild or repair roads and bridges.\n\n\"Emergency relief funding is an integral part of the federal-aid program,\" said Federal Highway Administrator Gregory Nadeau, in a news release. \"Part of our mission is to help states get back on track by restoring broken transportation links when disaster strikes.\"\n\nAbout $9.88 million of the money is coming to Texas for state-maintained roads, all related to storms in May that washed out highways and caused days of cleanup work.\n\nDespite water pouring onto Houston-area roads, Texas Department of Transportation officials said Friday that $146,000 in claims were filed in the Houston area, mostly cleanup-related work in central Houston and Waller County. A $44,000 claim was filed for cameras and related traffic management systems damaged during the Memorial Day weekend storms.\n\nCompared to other parts of the state, TxDOT spokeswoman Veronica Beyer said Houston's damages to state roads were minimal.\n\nNationwide, two areas hardest hit by storms represent more than half the federal emergency spending. Flooding in September 2013 severely damaged roads between Denver and Boulder, Colo., leading to $115.5 million in emergency relief. New York and New Jersey, still rebuilding damaged from Hurricane Sandy, received $92 million in federal aid.\n\nTexas, which got a late fall round of heavy rains, could apply for more relief, if warranted. A round of storms in late October submerged 330 spots on 232 state-maintained roads, according to reports, including a more than 10-mile segment of Interstate 45 between Houston and Dallas.\n\nAt the time, analysts predicted those storms could mean hundreds of millions of dollars in damages for state roads. So far, claims have been far below those estimates, which also consider costs that would not be covered by federal aid, such as economic loss from having roads closed."}

Hillary Clinton \u2013 Former Sec. of State Clinton came out strong by playing up her knowledge of the state and history as the Senator from New York. Except for her usual stubbornness on releasing the Goldman Sachs speech transcripts, there were no stumbles for Clinton. Hillary Clinton gave her usual solid performance. Clinton doesn't make mistakes and beat herself in these debates. Clinton's message has played better in closed Democratic primaries and in states with more diverse populations.\n\nClinton said nothing in this debate that should cost her votes with the Democratic electorate or put her odds of victory in New York in jeopardy. The Democratic candidates are clearly tired of each other, and the tense tone of the campaign was clearly visible during the debate. Hillary Clinton has been consistently strong in the Democratic debates, and Sen. Sanders was unable to knock her off of her game.\n\nClinton was able to broaden the conversation towards November while discussing Social Security and scored major points by discussing the fact that candidates have not gotten a single question on a woman's right to choose in eight debates.\n\nHillary Clinton came into the New York debate leading, and she will likely exit the debate still well ahead in the Empire State.\n\n\nLosers:\n\n1). Bernie Sanders \u2013 Bernie Sanders needed a game-changing debate performance, and too many of his answers were based on his stump speeches. Sanders continued to struggle on guns. Bernie Sanders couldn't provide a straight answer on how he would release hundreds of thousands of prisoners to keep his promise on reducing the prison population. Sanders offered up a vague answer of working with the states, which is fine unless the states don't want to work with him.\n\nThere was nothing in this debate that shifted the dynamic of the New York primary. Sanders needed to appeal to Democratic primary voters, but his answers remained tailored for Independents. Bernie Sanders didn't have a bad debate, but his performance was just like all of his previous performances. Sen. Sanders drew groans from the crowd when he said that he would withdraw the nomination of President Obama's Supreme Court nominee, and it is unclear how his answer will play with Democratic voter in the closed primaries. Sanders was more confrontational, but being more aggressive while offering many of the same answers that he has been using for months likely wasn't enough to cut into Hillary Clinton's double-digit New York lead.\n\n2). Democratic Voters \u2013 It is clear that this was a debate that Bernie Sanders pushed for, but it wasn't really necessary. The Democratic primary electorate is tired. Clinton has a big delegate lead, and it would take a string of miracle upsets for Bernie Sanders to catch up to her. Clinton and Sanders delivered a strong debate, but except for Clinton saying that she would sign a $15/hour minimum wage bill as president, there was little new said by both candidates during the debate."}

After heading the charter school since it opened in 2005, Negron became a full-time math teacher in August, just as new standards were reshaping what students are supposed to learn.\n\nNegron taught math at I.S.164 before starting KIPP Infinity and kept one foot in the classroom while serving as principal. But even for a seasoned educator, he said, shifting to the Common Core standards is a challenge.\n\n\"This is so much messier than what I'm used to and comfortable with,\" said Negron, who will appear this evening on the panel at GothamSchools' event about the Common Core in math. \"It used to be, I'm going to teach you this strategy and you're going to use it until your eyes pop out.\"\n\nThis year, responding to the Common Core's emphasis on solving problems in multiple ways, he is asking students to master three approaches.\n\nThe old strategy, Negron said, was more immediately satisfying to teachers and students: Students could feel accomplished more quickly and teachers could more easily measure understanding.\n\nBut the old way did not guarantee that students actually grasped the underlying mathematical concepts, Negron said. \"The way we've done it has created some pretty good robots,\" he said.\n\nChalkbeat New York Stay on top of New York education news with our morning newsletter.

The first of eight Standards for Mathematical Practice, which together describe the skills students of all ages should develop as they master grade-level content, emphasize the importance of this skill.\n\n\"Mathematically proficient students check their answers to problems using a different method, and they continually ask themselves, 'Does this make sense?'\" the standard reads. \"They can understand the approaches of others to solving complex problems and identify correspondences between different approaches.\"\n\nThese examples of student work will be on display at our event tonight, along with student work from other teachers who are participating in the discussion."}

Residents, nonprofits, and corporations are rehabilitating their city in a sustainable\u2013and often edible\u2013way.\n\n\"Detroit has really become the center of the urban agriculture movement,\" said Rebecca Salimen Witt.\n\nWitt runs a nonprofit, the Greening of Detroit, dedicated to beautifying the city through tree plantings, urban gardens, and other projects.\n\n\"We estimate that there are between 1500 and 2000 gardens in the city of Detroit,\" she said. \"Some of them are little postage stamp gardens in someone's backyard, and some of them are full scale urban farms that are growing produce for sale, serving as someone's primary living.\"\n\nEven the automakers are helping: last summer, General Motors began re-purposing 250 massive shipping crates into raised-bed planters, creating the Cadillac Urban Gardens. Last week, the corporation announced they'd expand the program with another 100 steel crates. Several hefty Ford grants have also made their way into green initiatives, too.\n\nOne farmer, who would identify himself only as Magnetic Sun, said he is a 33-year-old, lifelong Detroit resident.\n\nTired of seeing his friends struggle to feed their families, he started gardening on a lot near his home. Now he grows corn, tomatoes, zucchini, yellow squash, kale, sunflowers, and more. Walking around his garden, he pulls an ear of corn off a plant, shucks it and takes a bite.\n\n\"I feed the elderly people on the block, the youth they come down, they help, they take food home, we sell a little bit at the market, and you know, I feed myself and my family,\" he said. \"My aunty is 84 years old and has never seen a zucchini till last year. She's 84 years old and she's never seen the squash grow on the plant!\"\n\nThis summer, Magnetic Sun took a job working with the Greening of Detroit in their gardens. (\"They've taught me how to grow the biggest tomatoes I've ever seen\u2014bigger than my fist!\") Soon, he hopes to completely support himself and his family with his garden.\n\nPutting Down Roots\n\nIt's no surprise that urban gardening has become so popular in Detroit: it's a welcome contrast.\n\nResidential neighborhoods are still riddled with ruin. The city used to be home to 1.9 million, but is down to just 700,000 residents, leaving an estimated 30,000 acres of distressed land. So well-kept, carefully tended grounds are a welcome surprise.\n\nIt's a contrast that's at the core of Detroit's problems: with so much abandoned space, Detroit's land has lost its value, eroding the city's tax base and making it even harder for the city to maintain neighborhoods or keep empty lots from decaying further.\n\n\"Urban agriculture isn't a silver bullet for Detroit's vacant land opportunities,\" Witt said. \"But it's certainly part\u2026of a tapestry of vacant land uses that create for Detroiters a Detroit that is healthier, greener, the kind of place frankly that we all want to live in.\"\n\nCity planner Rob Anderson sees opportunity in Detroit's blight.\n\nWhen Anderson became a Detroit city planner two and a half years ago, the city was trying to develop its way out of crisis. Now, they're trying to restore, renovate, and green their way out of it.\n\n\"The desirability of living in that neighborhood on that block goes way up when you transform a vacant lot or a burned out building into a space like this. I mean, this is beautiful, this is a place people want to be,\" he said. \"People become more rooted in their place and that's what we need in this town.\"\n\nIn March, the city rewrote an old ordinance, legalizing urban agriculture in hopes of encouraging the green movement. Now, growing and selling produce in your backyard is allowed.\n\n\"The biggest thing we can do is try not to get in the way\u2013within reason, of course,\" said Brad Dick, the head of the city's maintenance and parks department. They try to support local gardeners by dropping off mulch gathered from their tree removal duties.\n\nA Tree Grows in Detroit\n\nFarther east in Detroit, businessman John Hantz came up with a solution to restoring his neighborhood: trees.\n\nHantz proposed a $30 million plan to the city to buy up 300 acres\u2014for $300 each\u2014over five years, use the land to farm trees\u2014oaks, maples, and poplars, mostly\u2014while maintaining it. Once sold, the trees would help the company recoup the money they'd spent maintaining the land. If the community allows it,"}

A spokesman said: \"The Metropolitan police service counter terrorism command (SO15) is investigating the contents of the video that was posted online in relation to the alleged murder of James Foley.\"\n\nMeanwhile, leading terrorism experts warned that the video was a highly orchestrated recruitment tool to lure \"psychopathic individuals\" to fight alongside Isis militants in Syria and Iraq.\n\nProf Peter Neumann, director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London, said the militant was chosen to front the video to cause maximum impact in the west. \"This is significant because it signifies a turn towards threatening the west. They are saying we're going to come after you if you bomb us,\" he said.\n\nNeumann said British fighters had been carrying out \"horrific acts\" like beheadings, torture and executions for a year and a half, but this appeared to be the first with a western victim.\n\nHe added: \"They clearly wanted someone who spoke fluent English because they wanted it to create maximum impact, especially in the US, and because there are not that many Americans it was probably the best second option.\n\n\"They want this to have maximum impact on the west and for parts of it to be streamed on American television networks they needed an English speaker, so it was more about the English language than the nationality.\n\n\"It's not significant that British fighters have been beheading and torturing because that's been happening for a year and a half. That sort of horrific stuff is something British jihadis have been doing for some time. You will find a number of instances of British jihadis executing, torturing and beheading other people \u2013 and we know it's not just Brits but other Europeans doing it \u2013 and occasionally this has come to the surface.\n\n\"Most people beheaded before were not westerners so that's why this is different. The significant thing is that this was an American and was connected to a direct message that 'we are targeting you'.\"\n\nLeading figures in the field of counter-terrorism said it would be possible for intelligence services to identify the militant, despite it being filmed in an unknown location with the fighter dressed head to toe in black.\n\nClaire"}

{"id": 259952, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "I have a piece in today's Times newspaper on extinction of species. Here it is, with added links:\n\nThe suitably named Dr Boris Worm, of Halifax, Nova Scotia, led the team that this week estimated the number of species on the planet at 8.7 million, plus or minus 1.3 million. That sounds about right. We human beings have described almost all the mammals, birds, butterflies and other conspicuous creatures, but new beetles, wasps, moths, flies and worms abound in every acre of tropical forest.\n\nSome patterns are clear. Most species are on land; marine life, though just as abundant, is slightly less diverse. Most are in the humid tropics; the rest of the globe is an ecological footnote to the rainforest. Most are animals - though plants, fungi and microbes vastly outweigh us beasts, they tend to come in fewer kinds, perhaps because plants hybridise and bacteria swap genes, blurring the boundaries of species. Most are insects: spiders/mites and molluscs take silver and bronze, but if Planet Earth had a mascot, it would be a ground beetle.\n\nSpecies come and go, lasting on average about a million years, scientists reckon. Islands are especially good species factories, evolution generating peculiar forms in isolation, as Charles Darwin spotted in the Gal\u00e1pagos. Lakes, being islands of water, are species factories for fish. Lake Victoria seems to have spawned some 500 species of cichlid fish from just a few ancestral species since it was last dry just 14,000 years ago. Some of these have now died out, after the introduction of predatory Nile perch.\n\nNobody quite knows what human beings are doing to the speciation rate, but in his paper Dr Worm makes the now routine claim that extinction rates are running at 100 or 1,000 times their normal rates, because of human interference. We are often told we are causing a \"sixth mass extinction\" similar to that wrought by the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs. So what is the evidence for this claim?\n\nOne estimate of the species extinction rate - 27,000 a year - came from the biologist E. O. Wilson, of Harvard University, based on an assumption that habitat loss leads to predictable species loss through a mathematical relationship called the species-area curve. The trouble is, the theory is flawed.\n\nA recent study by Stephen Hubbell and Fangliang He, of the University of California at Los Angeles, found that these \"estimated\" extinction rates are \"almost always much higher than those actually observed\" because destruction of forest habitat simply does not lead to proportionate species loss as predicted by the theory. In eastern America, in Puerto Rico and in the Atlantic rainforests of Brazil, more than 90 per cent of forest was extirpated, but the number of birds that died out locally were one, seven and zero respectively.\n\nAnother widely used estimate for the extinction rate - 40,000 species a year - came from Norman Myers, a British conservationist. Though often cited as if it were a scientific estimate, this number was more of an assumption. This is what Myers wrote in 1979: \"Let us suppose that, as a consequence of this man-handling of natural environments, the final one quarter of this century witnesses the elimination of one million species - a far from unlikely prospect. This would work out, during the course of 25 years, at an average extinction rate of 40,000 species per year.\" For more on Myers, see here.\n\nThere is no doubt that humans have caused a pulse of extinction, especially by introducing rats, bugs and weeds to oceanic islands at the expense of endemic species. Island species are often vulnerable to parasites, predators and competitors that continental species have evolved to cope with. Mauritius's dodos, New Zealand's moas, Madagascar's elephant birds and many of Hawaii's honeycreepers all succumbed to the introduction of rats, pigs, monkeys - and humans.\n\nBut now that most of these accidental introductions to islands have happened, the rate of extinctions is dropping, not rising, at least among birds and mammals. Bird and mammal extinctions peaked at 1.6 a year around 1900 and have since dropped to about 0.2 a year. Wilson's 27,000 a year should be producing (pro rata) 26 bird and 13 mammal extinctions a year. Myers would predict even more.\n\nMoreover, according to an analysis by the scholar Willis Eschenbach, of the 190 bird and mammal species that have gone extinct globally in the past 500 years, as recorded on the comprehensive list kept by the American Museum of Natural History, just nine were continental species (if you count Australia as an island, which in ecological terms it is).\n\nThey were, in chronological order: the bluebuck, the Labrador duck, the Algerian gazelle, the Carolina parakeet, the slender-billed grackle, the passenger pigeon, the Colombian grebe"}

Anyone making a purchase from bigger online brands like Amazon or NetFlix has likely been recommended books to buy or videos to watch. Indeed, many marketers and sales consultants have written about the effectiveness of product recommenders increasing sales.\n\nWhat do product recommenders do?\n\nThe problem solved by product recommenders is simple to state but difficult to do: take all your customers' past behaviors and find which products they are likely to buy next. Such recommendations solve two problems:\n\nDetermine the next product to buy. Most companies have too many products for customers to easily manage and browse. Giving them a ranked list, optimized for their tastes, will make it easier for them to buy something new. Lead lists for outbound campaigns. Similarly, if you are a company with a large number of customers, choosing which to contact or e-mail can be a costly decision. Product recommenders let you rank which customers are likely to buy a certain product, so you can target your sales efforts more effectively.\n\nOne of the most well-known forms of product recommendation is called \"collaborative filtering\". In one form of this filtering, customer purchase histories are compared to each other. Those with similar purchases are then grouped together and products that the group likes, but which a certain individual in the group has yet to buy, will be recommended.\n\nAs an example, suppose you are someone who has previously watched all Star Wars and Indiana Jones movies, but nothing else. A collaborative filter could see that others who have similar patterns have also watched the lesser-known \"American Graffiti\", and this would then be recommended to you.\n\nBest-in-class recommendation engines\n\nMost product recommenders, particularly for smaller companies, suffer from what is known as the \"cold start\" problem. If you have too few recommendations or if a customer has never made a purchase, how do you know what to recommend? More importantly, once they start buying, how do you make the recommendation as accurate as possible?\n\nAt Canopy Labs, we approach the problem through \"cross-domain\" recommendations. Rather than taking past purchases by themselves, we look at all aspects of a customer's behavior to better understand what they are like and make recommendations. Here is the data we take into account:\n\nEmail activity. Imagine that every email communication you send your customers were also a product. Those who open e-mails and click links are implicitly showing their preferences for content and offers. We use this to group people in a similar way we group through purchases.\n\nImagine that every email communication you send your customers were also a product.

Finally, we take into account the actual purchases customers have made, just like most other recommendation systems.\n\nDepending on industry and size of the company, the way you take into account the information above differs. For example, North American fashion retailers tend to benefit from past purchases and email activity \u2014 possibly because fashion trends are somewhat similar across North America. On the other hand, local commerce sites (e.g., daily deals websites, discount sites, etc.) often require demographic information to be taken into account for their product recommenders. This is likely because many of their products are location-specific and not available in all regions.\n\nFind out more about how to personalize your emails."}

Today, we'll take an insider's look at an Apple iCloud phishing gang that appears to work quite closely with organized crime rings \u2014 within the United States and beyond \u2014 to remotely unlock and erase stolen Apple devices.\n\nVictims of iPhone theft can use the Find My iPhone feature to remotely locate, lock or erase their iPhone \u2014 just by visiting Apple's site and entering their iCloud username and password. Likewise, an iPhone thief can use those iCloud credentials to remotely unlock the victim's stolen iPhone, wipe the device, and resell it. As a result, iPhone thieves often subcontract the theft of those credentials to third-party iCloud phishing services. This story is about one of those services.\n\nRecently, I heard from a security professional whose close friend received a targeted attempt to phish his Apple iCloud credentials. The phishing attack came several months after the friend's child lost his phone at a public park in Virginia. The phish arrived via text message and claimed to have been sent from Apple. It said the device tied to his son's phone number had been found, and that its precise location could be seen for the next 24 hours by clicking a link embedded in the text message.\n\nThat security professional source \u2014 referred to as \"John\" for simplicity's sake \u2014 declined to be named or credited in this story because some of the actions he took to gain the knowledge presented here may run afoul of U.S. computer fraud and abuse laws.\n\nJohn said his friend clicked on the link in the text message he received about his son's missing phone and was presented with a fake iCloud login page: appleid-applemx[dot]us. A lookup on that domain indicates it is hosted on a server in Russia that is or was shared by at least 140 other domains \u2014 mostly other apparent iCloud phishing sites \u2014 such as accounticloud[dot]site; apple-appleid[dot]store; apple-devicefound[dot]org; and so on (a full list of the domains at that server is available here).\n\nWhile the phishing server may be hosted in Russia, its core users appear to be in a completely different part of the world. Examining the server more closely, John noticed that it was (mis)configured in a way that leaked data about various Internet addresses that were seen recently accessing the server, as well as the names of specific directories on the server that were being accessed.\n\nAfter monitoring that logging information for some time, my source discovered there were five Internet addresses that communicated with the server multiple times a day, and that those address corresponded to devices located in Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico.\n\nHe also found a file openly accessible on the Russian server which indicated that an application running on the server was constantly sending requests to imei24.com and imeidata.net \u2014 services that allow anyone to look up information about a mobile device by entering its unique International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number. These services return a variety of information, including the make and model of the phone, whether Find My iPhone is enabled for the device, and whether the device has been locked or reported stolen.\n\nJohn said that as he was conducting additional reconnaissance of the Russian server, he tried to access \"index.php\" \u2014 which commonly takes one to a site's home page \u2014 when his browser was redirected to \"login.php\" instead. The resulting page, pictured below, is a login page for an application called \"iServer.\" The login page displays a custom version of Apple's trademarked logo as part of a pirate's skull and crossbones motif, set against a background of bleeding orange flames.\n\nJohn told me that in addition to serving up that login page, the server also returned the HTML contents of the \"index.php\" he originally requested from the server. When he saved the contents of index.php to his computer and viewed it as a text file, he noticed it inexplicably included a list of some 137 user names, email addresses and expiration dates for various users who'd apparently paid a monthly fee to access the iCloud phishing service.\n\n\"These appear to be 'resellers' or people that have access to the crimeware server,\" my source said of the user information listed in the server's \"index.php\" file.\n\nJohn told KrebsOnSecurity that with very little effort he was able to guess the password of at least two other users listed in that file. After John logged into the iCloud phishing service with those credentials, the service informed him that the account he was using was expired. John was then prompted to pay for at least one more month subscription access to the server to continue.\n\nPlaying along, John said he clicked the \"OK\" button indicating he"}

Sign up here.\n\nWe're going to spend a lot of time over the next 87 days contemplating the possibility of a Donald Trump presidency. Trump is a significant underdog \u2014 he has a 13 percent chance of winning the election according to our polls-only model and a 23 percent chance according to polls-plus. But those probabilities aren't that small. For comparison, you have a 17 percent chance of losing a \"game\" of Russian roulette.\n\nBut there's another possibility staring us right in the face: A potential Hillary Clinton landslide. Our polls-only model projects Clinton to win the election by 7.7 percentage points, about the same margin by which Barack Obama beat John McCain in 2008. And it assigns a 35 percent chance to Clinton winning by double digits.\n\nOur other model, polls-plus, is much more conservative about Clinton's prospects. If this were an ordinary election, the smart money would be on the race tightening down the stretch run, and coming more into line with economic \"fundamentals\" that suggest the election ought to be close. Since this is how the polls-plus model \"thinks,\" it projects Clinton to win by around 4 points, about the margin by which Obama beat Mitt Romney in 2012 \u2014 a solid victory but a long way from a landslide.\n\nBut the theory behind \"fundamentals\" models is that economic conditions prevail because most other factors are fought to a draw. In a normal presidential election, both candidates raise essentially unlimited money and staff their campaigns with hundreds of experienced professionals. In a normal presidential election, both candidates are good representatives of their party's traditional values and therefore unite almost all their party's voters behind them. In a normal presidential election, both candidates have years of experience running for office and deftly pivot away from controversies to exploit their opponents' weaknesses. In a normal presidential election, both candidates target a broad enough range of demographic groups to have a viable chance of reaching 51 percent of the vote. This may not be a normal presidential election because while most of those things are true for Clinton, it's not clear that any of them apply to Trump.\n\nA related theory is that contemporary presidential elections are bound to be relatively close because both parties have high floors on their support. Indeed, we've gone seven straight elections without a double-digit popular vote victory (the last one was Ronald Reagan's in 1984), the longest such streak since 1876-1900.\n\nAs with other theories of this kind, however, there's the risk of mistaking what's happened in the recent past for some sort of iron law of politics. Historically, the U.S. has ebbed and flowed between periods of close presidential elections \u2014 such in the late 19th century or early 21st century \u2014 and eras in which there were plenty of lopsided ones (every election in the 1920s and 1930s was a blowout).\n\nThese patterns seem to have some relationship with partisanship, with highly partisan epochs tending to produce close elections by guaranteeing each party its fair share of support. Trump's nomination, however, reflects profound disarray within the Republican Party. Furthermore, about 30 percent of Republican or Republican-leaning voters have an unfavorable view of Trump. How many of them will vote for Clinton is hard to say, but parties facing this much internal strife, such as Republicans in 1964 or Democrats in 1972 or 1980, have often suffered landslide losses.\n\nPerhaps the strongest evidence for a potential landslide against Trump is in the state-by-state polling, which has shown him underperforming in any number of traditionally Republican states. It's not just Georgia and Arizona, where polls have shown a fairly close race all year. At various points, polls have shown Clinton drawing within a few percentage points of Trump \u2014 and occasionally even leading him \u2014 in states such as Utah, South Carolina, Texas, Alaska, Kansas and even Mississippi.\n\nJust how bad could it get? Let's start by giving Clinton the 332 electoral votes that Obama won in 2012. That's obviously not a safe assumption: The race could shift back toward Trump, and even if it doesn't, Clinton could lose states such as Iowa or Nevada, where her polling has been middling even after her convention bounce. But as I said, we're going to focus on Clinton's upside case today.\n\nSo I'm going to list the states Romney won in order of how easy it is for Clinton to flip them, according to our polls-only model. The number in parentheses by each state represents the point at which the model estimates it would flip to Clinton, based on her lead in the national popular vote. For instance, South Carolina (+9.5) means that Clinton would be favored in South Carolina if she leads by at least 9.5 percentage points nationally, but not by less than that. These projections are based on where the model has each state projected currently, along with each state's elasticity score, a measure of how"}

According to the Inquisitr, Sanders has drawn attention to the issue using a variety of methods, including petitions, interviews, letters, and even a giant printout of a Trump tweet.\n\nMr. Trump must make it clear that he will keep his word and veto any legislation that cuts Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. pic.twitter.com/CsqkHCBaNc \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) January 5, 2017\n\nBy calling on the president-elect to keep his promises, Sanders has found common ground with Trump supporters on this topic, as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security are issues that a majority of both Democratic and Republican voters agree on. According to polling by NASI, an overwhelming number of Americans support the safety net programs, and are even willing to contribute more to preserve and improve benefits.\n\nMr. Trump: You told the American people that you would NOT cut Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. Keep your promises. pic.twitter.com/cDtICdLUjG \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) December 30, 2016\n\nAlong with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Sanders warned in a letter last month that Republicans would attempt to gut the Affordable Care Act and privatize Medicare using a fast-track budget tool. This dismantling of the healthcare system goes against the campaign promises made by President-elect Donald Trump, who vowed to the American people that he would not touch the popular safety net programs.\n\n\"Millions of Americans voted for Donald Trump after he promised not to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. He must be held to his promises and should veto any legislation which cuts these vital and necessary health programs.\"\n\nTim Fernholz at Quartz weighed in on the matter, noting that the Independent senator was at the helm of the first Democratic uprising against the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\"Democrats are planning their first major gesture of opposition to Donald Trump's presidency, and Bernie Sanders is leading the charge.\"\n\nAccording to a spokesperson, left-over donations from Sanders' presidential campaign will be used to organize the protest rallies. As the Daily Beast pointed out, this is in stark contrast to the way that the Clinton campaign spent their remaining campaign funds \u2013 by splurging on a fancy party for millionaire donors.\n\nOn January 9, Sanders is scheduled to participate in a CNN town hall, where he will discuss the upcoming protest events as well as the broader Democratic strategy going forward. Sanders was recently elected as the Outreach Chair for Senate Democrats.\n\nTo find or organize your local January 15 \"Our First Stand: Save Health Care\" protest rally, sign up here, visit the Our Revolution event page, join your local Bernie Facebook page or subscribe to the Political Revolution subreddit.\n\n[Featured Image by Win McNamee/Getty Images]"}

Across an ever-increasing amount of Earth's surface, that's no longer the case. With the advent of artificial lighting came the ability to transform night \u2014 inside buildings, under streetlights and neon signs, and in those vast areas where night's simply not so dark as it used to be.\n\nFor journalist Paul Bogard, author of The End of Night: Searching for Darkness in an Age of Artificial Light, one such place his family's lakeside camp in rural Minnesota. Thirty years ago the nights were pitch-black, the starscapes incandescent. Now there's a glow at the edge of the horizon, a growing dullness to the stars.\n\n\"That firsthand experience of a child, standing out on a dock and staring at the Milky Way, stays with you,\" said Bogard. \"That's one of the biggest things we're losing, or have lost, for our kids. More and more people have no idea what it's like.\"\n\nIt's not only lost starscapes that he laments, but darkness itself. WIRED talked to Bogard about what this could mean for humanity's existential and even physical health.\n\nWIRED: In the book, you argue that the loss of darkness isn't just a sentimental or aesthetic loss, but has health consequences. Can you explain?\n\nBogard: In terms of the physical effects, there's been a real explosion of research in the last 10 or 15 years on the subject of artificial light at night. Its effects on the human body fall into three areas: One, it affects our sleep. Sleep disorders are now tied to many major diseases. Secondly, it disrupts our circadian clock \u2014 the internal 24-hour rhythms that coordinate biological processes in our body, and are tuned to natural cycles of light and dark. Finally it impedes production of the hormone melatonin.\n\nThe lack of melatonin has been tied to increased risk of cancer, especially prostate and breast cancer. Researchers told me you can't say light at night gives you cancer, but it seems to be costing our health. A few years ago, the World Health Organization declared that the night shift is probably a carcinogen. Other studies are linking it to increased diabetes and cardiovascular disease risks.\n\nWIRED: How much of that is a consequence of artificial light, and how much is just not sleeping enough?\n\nBogard: The changes caused by artificial light at night are not caused by exposure to starlight, candlelight or moonlight. If you wake up in the middle of the night and there's no other light, my understanding is that it doesn't have an effect on the production of melatonin. It's only artificial light.\n\nOne of the most interesting discoveries of the last few years is of cells in our retinas that aren't particularly related to sight, but are sensitive to changes in daylight and seasonal light. The wavelengths to which these are most responsive are the blue wavelengths \u2014 which makes sense, because the sky is blue, and blue light means waking up. And more and more light in our society is of these wavelengths.\n\nThe new LED lights, which are going in all over the place, tend to be really rich in blue-white light. It looks white to us, but is full of blue. Our gadgets \u2014 our notebooks, our tablets, our televisions \u2014 are very rich in this. So many people like to lie in bed and read their iPads or watch TV before going to bed. They're being drenched in blue light. The message it's sending our brain is, \"Wake up!\"\n\n'The beauty we have on Earth is tremendous, and there's no other place to go. The night sky makes this clear.'WIRED: Are there effects on non-human animals?\n\nBogard: Tremendous effects, I think, and we're just starting to understand them. Life on Earth co-evolved with bright days and dark nights. We need both. So many species \u2014 roughly 60 percent of invertebrates and 30 percent of vertebrates \u2014 are nocturnal. Many more are active at dawn or dusk. These species have evolved to depend on darkness. When our artificial electric light invades their habitat, it could be as destructive as a bulldozer in daytime.\n\nResearch is only getting started on this. There's a 2006 book, Ecological Consequences of Artificial Night Lighting. There have been studies in the last few years showing how light at night affects bats, and another showing how new streetlights act as a vacuum for moths and other insects. They're drawn to the light, and initially there's a bonanza for predators, but they're either devoured or they become exhausted and die. It sucks the protein right out of the food chain.\n\nWIRED: In the book, you make the point that we think streetlights make us safer"}

Especially useful as the original box the tree came in starts to fall apart. I have a 7 - 7.5 foot pre-lit tree that breaks down into 3 sections with branches that fold up. Reading the information about this container convinced me that it would be large enough to store this tree. Well, in order to get the tree into the box, I had to first tie each section tightly to try to compress the branches. It was still to large to be able to put the lid on the box, but with pushing and shoving and the use of lots of duct tape, I was able to get the tree in the box. I think there was one box that was larger, but by the time I made my purchase that one was gone. Seasonal merchandise, so when it's gone, it's gone :-( I would still recommend this product though because I think it is a good storage option. Just don't expect it to be a good fit for a large or very full tree."}

Dash & Dawson (Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic Semi-Final)\n\nTension was running high in the NXT Arena as the first Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic Semi-Final got going. The mega team of NXT Champion Finn B\u00e1lor & Samoa Joe was out to continue their tear through the tournament, while the roughneck duo of Scott Dawson & Dash Wilder were out to pull the biggest upset of the tournament.\n\nTakeOver: Respect photos | Video highlights | Watch the show on WWE Network\n\nDespite Dawson & Wilder's best efforts to control the pace of the bout, B\u00e1lor & Joe bulldozed them at the start. The NXT Champion nearly had the victory wrapped up in minutes, with Dawson in position for the Coup de Grace, but Wilder distracted B\u00e1lor, allowing his partner to take out the enigmatic champion's knee.\n\nDawson & Wilder trapped B\u00e1lor in their corner, relentlessly working over the NXT Champion's knee, as he screamed in agony. Things looked bleak for the mega team as B\u00e1lor struggled to stand up, let alone fight back to his corner. But somehow, the demonic champion slipped out of Wilder's grasp and tagged in the submission master. Joe went on a rampage, until B\u00e1lor demanded to tag back in. Joe relented, hitting Wilder with the Muscle Buster, while B\u00e1lor came crashing down with the Coup de Grace after to cement their place in the tournament final. However, that Coup de Grace appeared to do further damage to B\u00e1lor's left knee, leaving the NXT Universe to wonder if he would be able to compete in the Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic at all.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Dash & Dawson look to the future\n\nBaron Corbin & Rhyno def. Jason Jordan & Chad Gable (Dusty Rhodes Tag Team Classic Semi-Final)\n\nThe mat masters of Jason Jordan & Chad Gable looked to have the massive duo of Baron Corbin & Rhyno off their game, using their speed and pure wrestling ability to stay one step ahead of their monstrous foes. The Man Beast was baffled early as Jordan & Gable took him down to the canvas repeatedly.\n\nAfter Gable trapped him in the ropes with an armbar, Rhyno finally had enough, sending Gable crashing to the floor with a big knee. The Lone Wolf smelled blood and pounced on Gable, hurling him into the LED boards on the ring apron. That gave the team of titans the opening they needed to take control of the match. Corbin & Rhyno worked over the former Olympian, with Gable trying to slip out of their clutches, only for a dirty trick to keep him away from Jordan.\n\nBut after Rhyno whiffed on a splash from the top rope, Gable finally reached his partner. Jordan came into the bout on fire, taking on The Man Beast and The Lone Wolf himself. The bout broke down into a brawl as all four men went at each other. Gable looked to have the victory in sight, after pulling off a stunning German suplex on the massive Corbin. However, Gable tried to spin around Corbin, only to meet the End of Days, as The Lone Wolf sent himself and Rhyno to the finals.\n\nAsuka def. Dana Brooke\n\nThe debuting Asuka attempted to offer a show of sportsmanship at the start of the bout, offering to shake Brooke's hand, only for The Total Diva to slap it away. The NXT newcomer showed her experience, keeping a hammerlock on tight as Brooke rolled through on several occasions attempting to escape.\n\nBrooke tried to get inside Asuka's head by slapping her across the face. That only incensed Asuka, who unleashed a flurry of devastating strikes on her rival. Unfortunately, Asuka also had to deal with Emma, who tried to interject herself into the bout at every opportunity. Brooke tried to take control of the bout, but ended up in an Asuka submission hold more often than not.\n\nAsuka finally put a stop to Emma's interference with a hard spinning back fist, before trapping Brooke in the Asuka Lock to earn her first WWE victory! The newcomer didn't hesitate to get a measure of payback for Dana ruining her contract signing after the bell, flooring The Total Diva with one last devastating roundhouse kick.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Asuka checks up on Dana Brooke\n\nApollo Crews def. Tyler Breeze\n\nTyler Breeze's quest to regain respect in NXT continued at TakeOver, as he battled undefeated newcomer Apollo Crews.

{"id": 259969, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "As mentioned last week, my primary aim is to get the system into a relatively bug-free state prior to adding new functionality. The graph above shows that I fixed quite a few this week, but I have also discovered quite a few too.\n\nAlthough no closer to starting the column movement code, it is still a good position to be in as I now have a system that has 13 fewer issues in it. Alas, not all coding can be glorious and exciting new functionality!\n\nMost of the work that took place this week occurred in the Armies module \u2013 the module that models all aspects of units and armies.\n\nThe first 'issue' was this one\u2026\n\nIssues orders to cavalry units\u2026\n\nRuns a 30 second turn and ends up with:\n\nThe units didn't exactly move very far\u2026\n\nThese kind of bugs can be quite hard to find as the system keeps track of a multitude of variables for each unit. These variables can be hard to follow because the system runs multi-threaded.\n\nLuckily, one of the pieces of work that I also did this week was to update the formation classification system to bring it up to date with the current modelling.\n\nThe classification system puts a symbol on a unit to tell the user whether it is Open Order (OO), Order (O), Close Order (CO) or Dense (D). The idea being that a player can instantly see how tightly packed a formation is \u2013 something that would be impossible to tell just by looking at the unit.\n\nThis subsystem was very old and didn't reflect what was really happening. However, this was rectified, resulting in units being properly classified.\n\nThat said, I should probably point out that the game does not use this classification \u2013 it knows a unit's precise measurements \u2013 the classification is solely a player aid only.\n\nIn my case, the classification helped track the issue above\u2026\n\nWhen I zoomed in onto one of the cavalry units I saw that its density classification is 'D' or dense. That would explain why the units were having problems moving!\n\nThese units were created very quickly using default unit sizes, formations, frontages and densities. However, it would appear that these defaults don't give you units that function well\u2026\n\nThis defined my next task:\n\n'Update the defaults to generate units that function correctly when created!'\n\nThe result:\n\nNote the defaults have made the cavalry units a lot larger. Ok, lets run a turn and see how they perform\u2026\n\nBingo! All sorted\u2026.\n\nWell almost\u2026.\n\nThe problem with the new defaults is that they highlight just how large the unit size variations can be. Alas, the Army Editor's display window just couldn't cope with some of these new sizes:\n\nDamn! I'm missing a fair bit of the unit. Creating a Chariot unit results in the whole screen being filled by part of that unit! Not good at all.\n\nConversely, small units like a Roman Maniple became very small and difficult to see.\n\nTo fix this, I altered the code in that pane to automatically zoom the camera to properly show off the chosen unit. This code was not trivial as one has to work out apparent sizes in metres based on the camera distance.\n\nNevertheless it got fixed:\n\nPerfectly zoomed!\n\nEven small units are now zoomed correctly:\n\nThe eagle eyed amongst you will have noticed that the window also gets a new scale in the bottom left so that users can more easily determine the size of a unit.\n\nFixes to tooling might seem a waste of time, but these tools are used to create the game assets \u2013 they will also be distributed with the game to allow players to create their own maps, units, armies and scenarios too\u2026.\n\nGoing back to the loaded scenario, I noticed another potential issue:\n\nI thought 'Oh No \u2013 the new classification system is broken already.'\n\nBased on general wargamer bias and expectation, the Macedonian unit seemed to have an incorrect classification. Such a unit would at least be close order, if not dense!\n\nHowever, after doing my research, I have discovered that this is in fact correct!\n\nThis is the default phalanx formation at 16 deep. The Macedonians didn't even give it a name, because it was the 'standard' formation. However, some texts do refer to this formation as the Open formation!!! Woot! My system seems to have classified correctly!\n\nIf the above unit closes down to the 8 deep Pyknosis formation, as used prior to contact, the result is:\n\nCO!!! Perfect. Closing the formation down further to the 4 deep Synaspismos results in the system correctly classifying it as 'D' or dense.\n\nOf course, when I did my first formation change, I noticed a bug where the visible model's density classification was"}

I also want to say that I consider it a great honor to share this program with Dr. Bennett, Dr. Commager, and Rabbi Heschel, some of the distinguished leaders and personalities of our nation. And of course it's always good to come back to Riverside Church. Over the last eight years, I have had the privilege of preaching here almost every year in that period, and it is always a rich and rewarding experience to come to this great church and this great pulpit.\n\nI come to this magnificent house of worship tonight because my conscience leaves me no other choice. I join you in this meeting because I am in deepest agreement with the aims and work of the organization which has brought us together, Clergy and Laymen Concerned About Vietnam. The recent statements of your executive committee are the sentiments of my own heart, and I found myself in full accord when I read its opening lines: \"A time comes when silence is betrayal.\" That time has come for us in relation to Vietnam.\n\nThe truth of these words is beyond doubt, but the mission to which they call us is a most difficult one. Even when pressed by the demands of inner truth, men do not easily assume the task of opposing their government's policy, especially in time of war. Nor does the human spirit move without great difficulty against all the apathy of conformist thought within one's own bosom and in the surrounding world. Moreover, when the issues at hand seem as perplexing as they often do in the case of this dreadful conflict, we are always on the verge of being mesmerized by uncertainty. But we must move on.\n\nSome of us who have already begun to break the silence of the night have found that the calling to speak is often a vocation of agony, but we must speak. We must speak with all the humility that is appropriate to our limited vision, but we must speak. And we must rejoice as well, for surely this is the first time in our nation's history that a significant number of its religious leaders have chosen to move beyond the prophesying of smooth patriotism to the high grounds of a firm dissent based upon the mandates of conscience and the reading of history. Perhaps a new spirit is rising among us. If it is, let us trace its movement, and pray that our own inner being may be sensitive to its guidance. For we are deeply in need of a new way beyond the darkness that seems so close around us.\n\nOver the past two years, as I have moved to break the betrayal of my own silences and to speak from the burnings of my own heart, as I have called for radical departures from the destruction of Vietnam, many persons have questioned me about the wisdom of my path. At the heart of their concerns, this query has often loomed large and loud: \"Why are you speaking about the war, Dr. King? Why are you joining the voices of dissent?\" \"Peace and civil rights don't mix,\" they say. \"Aren't you hurting the cause of your people?\" they ask. And when I hear them, though I often understand the source of their concern, I am nevertheless greatly saddened, for such questions mean that the inquirers have not really known me, my commitment, or my calling. Indeed, their questions suggest that they do not know the world in which they live. In the light of such tragic misunderstanding, I deem it of signal importance to try to state clearly, and I trust concisely, why I believe that the path from Dexter Avenue Baptist Church -- the church in Montgomery, Alabama, where I began my pastorate -- leads clearly to this sanctuary tonight.\n\nI come to this platform tonight to make a passionate plea to my beloved nation. This speech is not addressed to Hanoi or to the National Liberation Front. It is not addressed to China or to Russia. Nor is it an attempt to overlook the ambiguity of the total situation and the need for a collective solution to the tragedy of Vietnam. Neither is it an attempt to make North Vietnam or the National Liberation Front paragons of virtue, nor to overlook the role they must play in the successful resolution of the problem. While they both may have justifiable reasons to be suspicious of the good faith of the United States, life and history give eloquent testimony to the fact that conflicts are never resolved without trustful give and take on both sides. Tonight, however, I wish not to speak with Hanoi and the National Liberation Front, but rather to my fellow Americans.\n\nSince I am a preacher by calling, I suppose it is not surprising that I have seven major reasons for bringing Vietnam into the"}

Just as the R+L=J theory has always held, Jon's mother is Lyanna Stark, his father is Rhaegar Targaryen, and Ned is his uncle. What did Lyanna whisper to Ned on Game of Thrones ? Her dying words could fill in the remaining pieces to the puzzle.\n\nHBO's subtitles only give you that she \"whispers\" and then, \"If Robert finds out he'll \u2014 you know he will.\" That's not much. However, with the volume up and my headphones and a few close readings, there is only one major piece of information missing. This is what Lyanna says to Ned:\n\nNo, no water. Listen to me, Ned. His name is ... if Robert finds out, he'll kill him. You know he will. You have to protect him. Promise me, Ned. Promise me.\n\nThat's a little more, but wait \u2014 what is Jon Snow's real name? I think that's the only bit that's unclear. It's possible that she was saying \"his name is Targaryen\" or \"his name is Jon,\" but since she was completely muffled in that moment, I think the reveal of his true name must be significant. It's possible that Ned renamed the baby Jon, which is unassuming, but his mother named him something else. The only Targaryen name which starts with a \"J\" that I can find is Jaehaerys \u2014 which doesn't seem to fit Jon's personality one bit, if you ask me.\n\nHowever, if you watch Lyanna's lips when she's whispering, it doesn't look like the name she says starts with \"J\" at all. It's almost certainly not Jon. It seems likely that Ned named him after his former guardian, Jon Arryn. I don't think Lyanna gave him a Stark name, because Ned seems to understand the significance of Jon just from his hearing his first name. In my opinion, that could also clue Ned in to the fact (which is still just a popular, unconfirmed theory at this point) that Rhaegar and Lyanna ran away together. If she had been kidnapped and raped, I feel she would have given her baby a Stark name. What if she said \"His name is Azor Ahai\"? That would be wild, and pretty ambitious for a baby name. Rhaegar's children with Elia were named Aegon and Rhaenys. So, looking at Targaryen names, I am going to toss Aerion, Aerys, and Rhaegon into consideration \u2014 though my main guess is something like Rhaegard, which combines a bit of House Stark and House Targaryen.\n\nNow, will Jon Snow accept a new name? Probably not. Way back in Season 1, Tyrion Lannister gave him the advice to \"Never forget who you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you.\" Rhaegar Targaryen was married to Elia Martell at the time of Jon's conception, so he's still a bastard even if he is a Targaryen. After all that he's been through, I don't think Jon Snow would be willing to change the name that has defined him in so many ways.\n\nImages: Helen Sloan/courtesy of HBO; Giphy"}

Drowning is the only traditional way to die that has been removed since there's currently no swim pools in game, however all the other ways are still available. There's also three new ways to die originated from the new dynamic emotion system. If you're looking for different ways to kill your sims, then keep reading.\n\n1. Starvation\n\nThe basics of life are always present in The Sims, which makes it no surprise that eating is essential to keep your sims alive. Food restriction for too long will lead your sims into imminent death.\n\nHow to trigger this death: Abstain from eating for several days.\n\n2. Old Age\n\nNo one lives forever and there's nothing more full-filing than living a complete long life. In The Sims 4, players can live properly during their elderly phase but eventually their body will give up and natural death will occur.\n\nHow to trigger this death: Live a healthy life until the end of your elder days.\n\n3. Fire\n\nBeing cautious in the kitchen will mostly avoid this type of death but it can always happen, especially if your sims is not experienced enough in culinary methods. When you're caught by a fire and you're unable to extinguish it in time, your sims will be consumed by the flames.\n\nHow to trigger this death: Start a fire and let the flames get close. A good way to trigger a fire is to use a cheap oven and an inexperienced cooker.\n\n4. Electrocution\n\nAnother death path that has been featured in all Sims games is the electrocution. This is not an easy way to die, simply because the chances to get electrocuted are low. Still, your sims can suffer an accident and be shocked to death, literally.\n\nHow to trigger this death: Repair electronic objects repeatedly with a handiness inexperienced sims. Eventually, the event will generate.\n\n5. Overexertion\n\nGoing beyond your body's capabilities in The Sims 4 will activate an unexpected way to die, death by overexertion. This type of death can occur at any age from the young adult stage beyond and there's several ways to trigger it.\n\nHow to trigger this death: Push your sims to the limits with physical exercise (until you get the -40 sore uncomfortable moodlet), then WooHoo. Your sims will go over the limits and perish.\n\n6. Embarrassment\n\nDying from embarrassment sounds ridiculous but it's one of the new death possibilities in The Sims 4. To unlock this death you need to humiliate your sims in many ways. Peeing in your pants, having an awkward social encounter or having another sims invading your privacy will drive your sims insane and overly depressed, which can be lethal.\n\nHow to trigger this death: Embarrass your sims in several ways until he/she can't handle it anymore.\n\n7. Laughter\n\nAnother death generated by emotions is the laughter. It literally means that your sims can die from laughing too much. Just as the electrocution, this event has low probabilities to happen so patience is the main key.\n\nHow to trigger this death: Get your sims into the playful mood and repeat jokes and funny interactions.\n\n8. Laganaphyllis Simnovorii (Cow Plant)\n\nMature Cow Plants can devour sims causing immediate death. This type of plant is rare and hard to get, you can see how to get one here.\n\nHow to trigger this death: Try to get the Cow Plant's cake.\n\n9. Social Services\n\nEven though this is not a real death it works as such. If sims don't take proper care of their child, the social services will take them away and there will be no further contact, working as if the child died (at least to the family).\n\nHow to trigger this death: Do not feed your child for several days.\n\nHere's a full list of possible ways to kill your sims but be aware that ghosts do not exist anymore and certain deaths won't leave a grave behind.\n\nComments\n\ncomments"}

But you're going to have to pay some taxes.\n\nWith President Obama busy spending much of his time trying to stop House Republicans from purposely destroying the economy in order to get the kind of cuts to Medicare they've spent years campaigning against, most of America has missed that we now have what some experts are calling the most progressive tax code since 1979.\n\nThe \"fiscal cliff\" deal raised taxes on the richest that come into effect just as new taxes to fund ObamaCare begin:\n\nThat deal includes a host of tax increases on the rich. It raises the tax rate to 39.6 percent from 35 percent on income above $400,000 for individuals, and $450,000 for couples. The rate on dividends and capital gains for those same taxpayers was bumped up 5 percentage points, to 20 percent. Congress also reinstated limits on the amount households with more than $300,000 in income can deduct. On top of that, two new surcharges \u2014 a 3.8 percent tax on investment income and a 0.9 percent tax on regular income \u2014 hit those same wealthy households.\n\nThese taxes are going to the people who can most afford them and have benefited the most even as millions are out of work. Basically, Mitt Romney will go from paying around a 9%-13% tax rate to something closer 20%. Will that stopping him from \"taking risks\" like sitting around and reaping massive gains from investments he made a decade ago? Not likely.\n\nAfter taxes went up on the rich in 1993, a massive economic boom followed. You can't say the tax increases caused the longest economic expansion in American history \u2014 though conservatives would surely crow if tax cuts led to such a boom \u2014 but it certainly didn't prevent it.\n\n65 years of shifting the tax burden from the rich to the middle class hasn't led to growth as promised, instead it's led to a massive accumulation of wealth by the richest 1%, according to report by the Congressional Research Service.\n\nThe results of the analysis in this report suggest that changes over the past 65 years in the top marginal tax rate and the top capital gains tax rate do not appear correlated with economic growth. The reduction in the top statutory tax rates appears to be uncorrelated with saving, investment, and productivity growth. The top tax rates appear to have little or no relation to the size of the economic pie. But as a small proportion of taxpayers are affected by changes in the top statutory tax rates, this finding is not unexpected. However, the top tax rate reductions appear to be correlated with the increasing concentration of income at the top of the income distribution. As measured by IRS data, the share of income accruing to the top 0.1% of U.S. families increased from 4.2% in 1945 to 12.3% by 2007 before falling to 9.2% due to the 2007-2009 recession. At the same time, the average tax rate paid by the top 0.1% fell from over 50% in 1945 to about 25% in 2009.\n\nWe've reversed this trend of ever increasing giveaways and we've done for a crazy reason: to make sure all Americans have access to life-saving healthcare.\n\nThere are imperfections in everything, which is why I oppose all purity tests except for food and drink. I keep wondering who will be the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, for instance, who proposes saving $100 billion over the next decade by implementing a public option.\n\nThe Bush tax cuts were designed to break a budget that had been balanced to justify eventual cuts to government services. I still believe that. Thus we still have a structural deficit that will require extraordinary growth to fix, something the GOP will do whatever they can to prevent until they take the White House.\n\nBut let's not miss the big story here: Those who benefit the most are being asked to pay more to help making America a healthier fairer place. That sounds suspiciously like change I can believe in."}

The article \"went viral\" via Facebook and has been viewed thousands of times since October. We knew we wanted to learn more about Kyle, his soccer career, and his fight to heal and return to the pitch. So we sent Kyle a series of questions.\n\nWe used the term \"Legend\" in the previous story headline. Kyle's friends have gotten a lot of mileage out of that term since then. What can you say? Kyle got back to our questions right away. How? He texted them via cell phone while in an ambulance heading back to Seattle for more therapy. Legend indeed!\n\nGo Fund Me: Kyle Trussell\n\nPort Angeles from U-9 to Adult Co-Ed\n\n\"I have a natural love for soccer,\" Kyle tells us. \"I remember when I was 6 or 7, My mother tried to make me play tee ball and I cried the whole way there. \"I wanna play soccer!\" I said. When I was 9 I heard of a \"select\" team called Dare and at the time I was a goalie. I called Jeffrey Pitman and asked if I could play for D.A.R.E. He noticed I was one of the faster kids on the team (back then of course, haha) so I played striker. Then as the years passed Jeffrey noticed I had a higher soccer IQ than most of the other kids and put me at center mid. So year after year Jeffrey advanced us and in 1993/1994 we got a sponsor named Todd MacFarlane, the creator of \"Image,\" a budding comic book at the time and we went from \"Classic\" all the way to P2, higher than any team from the Peninsula had ever gone. Well since I was a year younger than everyone I joined another another team called Elan out of a nearby town called Poulsbo at U-19, also a P2 team coached by Dan Atkinson, another great coach. Pitman received the coaching position at Peninsula College so I played a half a season there at center mid before a hamstring injury ended my season. Then I was nominated team captain at U23 Regionals (we lost). Now I play in tournaments and a local city league which has evolved into a greatly competitive co-ed League with some great soccer being played. Special thanks to Tim Tucker for making it such a great soccer community up here in Port Angeles/Sequim and Dave Brasher for being a catalyst also.\"\n\nSuper time at the Super Cup\n\nKyle played at the first annual Super Cup pitting Port Angeles against Sequim. It was a soccer high coming just before the big emotional low of the accident. \"The first ever Super Cup was amazing! Tim Tucker and Dave Brasher pioneered the event. Just being asked to play was an incredible honor because there are lots of in-shape young guys representing Port Angeles and on top of that coach Kanyon Anderson and coach Chris Saari decided I was a starter at offensive center mid! The Super Cup is huge because Sequim is our rival town in high school sports and is also rivaled in city league soccer. To be one of the best 25 in our area still at age 32 means a lot to me because at my age you constantly wonder \"Can I still play with these young guys?\" Being able to perform with the college boys is a lot harder now obviously but it's alot of fun having the competition.\"\n\nEvery day is \"Talk like a Pirate\" Day\n\nThe Peninsula College Pirates Men of the NWAC won the league title on Sunday. Afterwards they posed with a jersey marked \"Trusseller\" and signed by many in the Port Angeles area. Kyle was touched by the gestured and remains a fan of the PCC soccer experience.\n\n\"The Pirates program is something else. New coach Cale Rodriguez did an excellent job keeping the program prestigious, just the way coach Andrew Chapman left it. Both the men and women's programs have evolved into monsters of the NWAC. Kids from all over are coming up here to this astounding soccer community and the support they are receiving is another thing that gets them through their grueling seasons.\"\n\nThe Road back to the Soccer Pitch: Assist to Port Angeles\n\nTrussell suffered serious, life-threatening injuries in the accident. (Do you really want to see a photo?) Since then he's had numerous surgeries and work inside and out. The whole time his family, friends and soccer community have been there.\n\n\"Holy Wow! is what I have to say about our soccer community,\" Kyle says. \"So far, no exaggeration, I have had a visitor every day during my recovery helping the days go by and most are from the soccer community.

With failing hearts, these patients have no other options; heart tissue, unlike other parts of the body, is unable to heal itself once it is damaged. Fortunately, recent work by a group at Carnegie Mellon could one day lead to a world in which transplants are no longer necessary to repair damaged organs.\n\n\"We've been able to take MRI images of coronary arteries and 3-D images of embryonic hearts and 3-D bioprint them with unprecedented resolution and quality out of very soft materials like collagens, alginates and fibrins,\" said Adam Feinberg, an associate professor of Materials Science and Engineering and Biomedical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. Feinberg leads the Regenerative Biomaterials and Therapeutics Group, and the group's study was published in the October 23 issue of the journal Science Advances.\n\n\"As excellently demonstrated by Professor Feinberg's work in bioprinting, our CMU researchers continue to develop novel solutions like this for problems that can have a transformational effect on society,\" said Jim Garrett, Dean of Carnegie Mellon's College of Engineering. \"We should expect to see 3-D bioprinting continue to grow as an important tool for a large number of medical applications.\"\n\nTraditional 3-D printers build hard objects typically made of plastic or metal, and they work by depositing material onto a surface layer-by-layer to create the 3-D object. Printing each layer requires sturdy support from the layers below, so printing with soft materials like gels has been limited.\n\n\"3-D printing of various materials has been a common trend in tissue engineering in the last decade, but until now, no one had developed a method for assembling common tissue engineering gels like collagen or fibrin,\" said TJ Hinton, a graduate student in biomedical engineering at Carnegie Mellon and lead author of the study.\n\n\"The challenge with soft materials -- think about something like Jello that we eat -- is that they collapse under their own weight when 3-D printed in air,\" explained Feinberg. \"So we developed a method of printing these soft materials inside a support bath material. Essentially, we print one gel inside of another gel, which allows us to accurately position the soft material as it's being printed, layer-by-layer.\"\n\nOne of the major advances of this technique, termed FRESH, or \"Freeform Reversible Embedding of Suspended Hydrogels,\" is that the support gel can be easily melted away and removed by heating to body temperature, which does not damage the delicate biological molecules or living cells that were bioprinted. As a next step, the group is working towards incorporating real heart cells into these 3-D printed tissue structures, providing a scaffold to help form contractile muscle.\n\nBioprinting is a growing field, but to date, most 3-D bioprinters have cost over $100,000 and/or require specialized expertise to operate, limiting wider-spread adoption. Feinberg's group, however, has been able to implement their technique on a range of consumer-level 3-D printers, which cost less than $1,000 by utilizing open-source hardware and software.\n\n\"Not only is the cost low, but by using open-source software, we have access to fine-tune the print parameters, optimize what we're doing and maximize the quality of what we're printing,\" Feinberg said. \"It has really enabled us to accelerate development of new materials and innovate in this space. And we are also contributing back by releasing our 3-D printer designs under an open-source license.\"\n\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zfl_tFdt2D4&feature=youtu.be"}

Praising Ledger as \"brilliant,\" Hardy admitted that he never sees the late Australian actor as a competitor when it comes to who's the best in portraying Batman's archenemy.\n\n\"No, I don't think absolutely,\" he told Collider when asked if he has any apprehension for being the guy that would follow Ledger's Joker. \"That would be putting myself in a competition with somebody who's clearly brilliant.

But it was his refusal to rule out a third-party presidential run -- a move that could deny Republicans the White House -- that drew gasps in the audience and sparked anger from his opponents.\n\n\"I mean, this is what's wrong. He buys and sells politicians of all stripes. He's already hedging his bet on the Clintons, OK?\" said Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul.\n\nThe ever-unapologetic Trump then chastised the country for being too \"politically correct.\"\n\n\"I've been challenged by so many people and I don't frankly have time for total political correctness,\" Trump quipped.\n\nExplosive start\n\nIt was an explosive start to the first GOP debate in a campaign season already upended by Trump, the unfiltered and brash real estate magnate.

The lower tier of presidential contenders had their brief moment in the sun earlier Thursday at a debate in which Carly Fiorina delivered a memorable and polished performance.\n\nHigh-stakes moment for Trump\n\nBut the prime-time debate attracted more attention and served as a particularly high-stakes moment for Trump, whose early dominance has both stunned -- and aggravated -- members of his own party. National Republican leaders have at times seemed unsure of what to make of the fact that such a no-filter politician with no obligations to the party could unexpectedly become the GOP's standard-bearer. The evening was also an opportunity for Bush to move past a shaky few days that included controversial comments about women's health care along with an uncomfortable performance at a New Hampshire candidate forum.\n\nThe open contempt for Trump was on full display at the earlier debate. It took only 11 minutes before candidates came out swinging against Trump.\n\nLesser-known contenders including former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Fiorina slammed Trump, blasting the billionaire businessman's conservative credentials and friendly relationship with Hillary and Bill Clinton.\n\n\"I talked about Donald Trump from the standpoint of being an individual who is using his celebrity rather than his conservatism,\" said Perry, who has positioned himself as one of Trump's biggest antagonists on the trail. \"How can you run for the Republican nomination and be for single-payer health care?\"\n\nFor his part, Trump found ways to mock his rivals. When asked to address some of his businesses that went bankrupt, Trump pivoted to the financial woes of New Jersey -- a clear swipe at Christie.\n\n\"I had the good sense to leave Atlantic City, which by the way, Caesars just went bankrupt,\" Trump said, then gestured to Christie. \"Chris can tell you.\"\n\nLater in the debate, Bush cautioned that Trump's \"divisive\" language could be detrimental to the Republican Party.\n\n\"We're going to win when we unite people with a hopeful, optimistic message,\" he said.\n\nA Bloomberg survey released Tuesday had Trump at 21%, handing him a double-digit lead over both Bush, who was at 10%, and Wisconsin Gov.

The lead he built in the championship was so large that although Button did not win again that season, he was able to take the Drivers' title.\n\nThis year, turbocharged engines have returned to F1, and Mercedes has come up with an innovative design that has given the team (and to a lesser extent, its engine customers) a significant advantage on the track.\n\nThe innovation is that the two parts of the turbocharger, the turbine and the compressor, are split rather than packaged together, as per usual. Sky Sports' Martin Brundle explains it well in this video:\n\nIn hindsight, this trick seems relatively simple, although it is obviously not\u2014otherwise Mercedes would not be the only manufacturer to come up with it.\n\nIn Motor Sport Magazine (via Sky Sports) Mark Hughes detailed the numerous advantages of this turbocharger design, including less turbo lag, more power available from the Energy Recovery Systems and greater fuel efficiency.\n\nHe also notes ancillary benefits such as smaller sidepods\u2014meaning improved aerodynamic efficiency, since the air going from the turbocharger to the engine does not require as much cooling\u2014as well as a better centre of gravity for the car.\n\nI wrote before the season that teams designing their own engines and chassis would have a significant advantage this season. While that has not been the case for Ferrari, it certainly has for Mercedes.\n\nForce India, Williams and McLaren all have the same Mercedes power unit, and all have improved significantly relative to last season. However, they had access to the power units much later than the Mercedes design team and so were not able to find all the same aerodynamic advantages that the Silver Arrows have.\n\nMark Thompson/Getty Images\n\nThe biggest advantage for Mercedes, though, might be the engine homologation rules. From February 28, engine development has been frozen, aside from fixing reliability issues or generating cost savings (and then only with the approval of the FIA).\n\nThis means that Renault and Ferrari will be unable to copy the Mercedes design until next season.\n\nWhile some fans may be worried that Mercedes' running away with the championship will be as uninteresting as Sebastian Vettel's winning streak at the end of last season, the 1988 season is probably a much better comparison.\n\nThat year, McLaren had the best car by far\u2014the MP4/4 won 15 of 16 races\u2014but the championship battle was anything but boring. Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost duelled back and forth and the Drivers' title was not decided until the second-to-last race of the season.\n\nWith any luck, we will see a similar tilt between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg this year\u2014even if Mercedes does have the Constructors' Championship wrapped up by the summer break.\n\nFollow Matthew Walthert on Twitter:\n\nFollow @MatthewWalthert"}

Those stories left a searing impression on me,\" she continued.\n\nClinton has said more taxpayer money needs to go to the Planned Parenthood abortion business and Clinton demonstrated her unyielding commitment to abortion and the Planned Parenthood abortion business, accepting their endorsement during a pro-abortion rally \u2014 saying she would be the abortion business' president.\n\n\"I will always defend Planned Parenthood and I will say consistently and proudly, Planned Parenthood should be funded, supported and protected, not undermined, misrepresented and demonized,\" Clinton said. \"As your president, I will always have your back.\"\n\nAt a speech to the Women in the World Conference in April 2015, Hillary Clinton argued, \"Far too many women are denied access to reproductive health care (aka. abortion) and safe childbirth, and laws don't count for much if they're not enforced,\" In order to expand worldwide access to abortion, she suggested that \"deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed.\"\n\nIn May 2015, the U.S. House passed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to protect unborn babies 20 weeks and older from excruciating late abortions. In addition to a statement slamming House lawmakers for advancing the bill, Clinton tweeted, \"When it comes to women's health, there are two kinds of experts: women and their doctors. True 40+ years ago, true today.\"\n\nAt a presidential forum at Drake University, Clinton called ending the life of another human being a \"fundamental human right.\"\n\nThe first order of business for Clinton and her friends at the abortion company is to force Americans to pay for abortions with their tax dollars by attempting to overturn the Hyde Amendment, which has protected Americans from funding most all abortions since the late 1970s. Upheld by the Supreme Court, the Hyde Amendment is now a target of abortion advocates who have moved from pro-choice to pro-abortion \u2014 forcing Americans not only to accept unlimited abortions before birth but to pay for them."}

Host Anita Sarkeesian sends the show out with little fanfare, focusing the final installment on the sorry state of \"lady sidekicks\" in games.\n\nThis episode looks at games like BioShock Infinite, Ico and Resident Evil 4 to highlight how female companions \"often function as cheerleaders\" for stronger, more capable male leads.\n\n\"These interactions are rarely depicted as mutually supportive,\" Sarkeesian explains after running through clips of familiar AI-controlled, distressed damsels. \"It's not nearly as common in these scenarios for the male player character to offer emotional support to their female sidekick, to tell her that she's doing a great job. These particular sidekicks aren't designed as characters that players can actively engage in developing a relationship with, characters who are fully fleshed-out people with their own goals and desires that sometimes require players to compromise their own wants or desires.\"\n\nGames have gotten better in this regard in recent years, Sarkeesian says. The Last of Us and its expansion, Left Behind, enable women to protect themselves and each other. Even the dog-like Trico from The Last Guardian shows growth when it comes to designing companions for playable male characters; he's the one offering protection to the at-times helpless lead, as opposed to the other way around.\n\nThus marks the end of Tropes vs. Women's second season, which began earlier last year. Sarkeesian and crew recently wrapped Ordinary Women, a new series which broadens the scope to important female figures from throughout history.\n\nUpdate: Sarkeesian reflected upon making the entire Tropes vs. Women series in a follow-up blog post.\n\n\"This is one of the most emotionally complicated projects I've ever created. It has been simultaneously awful and wonderful, and the journey is one which I will most certainly never forget,\" she wrote. \"One that would never have happened without the incredible and generous support of our nearly 7000 Kickstarter backers, and countless others who encouraged us along the way.\"\n\nThe post recounts the history of the show, as well as gathers up all of its episodes in one place. Sarkeesian also noted that Feminist Frequency will return with another, different series soon."}

{"id": 259994, "ended": true, "length": 656, "text": "Lindsey asks: How fast do electrons flow inside electrical cables?\n\nYou may be surprised to learn that electrons flow through a typical copper wire much slower than a turtle walks.\n\nEach wire that conducts a flow of electrons, producing usable electric current, is composed of billions of atoms. To move along it, the electrons have to traverse these atoms, randomly zig-zagging their way as they do, resulting in the net flow rate, called \"drift velocity,\" in a given direction being quite slow.\n\nHow slow exactly? To calculate it, we use this formula: I = n*A*v*Q or v = I/(n*A*Q)\n\nI is the current, n is the number of electrons per cubic meter, A is the cross-section of the wire, Q is the charge of an electron and v is the drift velocity of the electrons.\n\nSince the number of electrons in a copper wire (n) is 8.5 * 1028 per m3, and the charge of an electron (Q) is 1.6 * 10-19C, if we also know the cross sectional area and the current, we can calculate the electrons' drift velocity.\n\nFor example, suppose you have a current of 14 amps and a copper wire with a cross section of 3 * 10-6 m2. Plug in all the numbers and you get that the electrons are moving at a speed of 3.4 * 10-4 m/s \u2013 or about one-third of a millimeter per second.\n\nTo put it in values that are easier to conceptualize, this works out to about 1.2 meters (4.1 feet) per hour- a rate far slower than the average box turtle, which can cover about 800 feet in that same amount of time.\n\nSo how is it that something that is essentially slower than a turtle can more or less instantaneously turn on a light across a room?\n\nChain reaction.\n\nThe atoms in the wire are crammed together cheek to jowl, which, while it makes the going slow, also has the electrons more or less abutting one another. When the switch is turned on, thanks to the electrical potential difference created by the generator, a force is created to move the electrons, with each pushing its neighbor, which in turn pushes its neighbor and so on all the way through the wire.\n\nSo, while no electrons zoom through the wire to turn on the light as you might have previously thought, it ends up seeming like that is what's happening. This is not unlike how when you turn on your faucet, water instantly comes out despite the fact that your water source might be many miles away.\n\nIf you liked this article, you might also enjoy our new popular podcast, The BrainFood Show (iTunes, Spotify, Google Play Music, Feed), as well as:\n\nBonus Fact:\n\nThe land speed record for a tortoise in competition was set by a leopard tortoise named Bertie who flew up an 18-foot uphill track in just under 20 seconds (about 0.61 mph) in 2014.\n\nExpand for References"}
{"id": 259995, "ended": false, "length": 1024, "text": "The week after my 30th birthday, my best friend had me committed to a psych ward. Two days later, I had emerged with a life-changing diagnosis. The hard part hadn't even started yet.\n\nI deserved to be committed. I needed it. For a long time, I had been in a dark, painful mood, a mood that had steadily transitioned into my personality. When I felt anger, I felt it so intensely that it took over my whole body. I would go to the grocery store with a carefully composed list, walk through the aisles fuming, and then leave so furious that I completely forgot to buy any food. The anger\u2014which could have been over anything from a fight with a friend to a political issue\u2014often lasted for weeks. Also, I was tired\u2014always, always bone-tired. I was so exhausted that it was a huge physical effort to sit at my desk and type, except for rare weeks of nonstop energy in which I came up with an idea, worked to make it happen, watched it happen, and then treated it like a toy I'd gotten bored with after several days. I could always get my paying work done, but anything outside of that was subject to my ever-fluctuating energy levels. My emotions seemed remote, flat, hard to discern, as if I were trying to see them through dirty glass. I couldn't really feel anything, and what I could feel was bad. I pulled away from people. I was determined not to trust anyone. I was depressed, in other words, except for those strangely productive weeks and long, terrifying rushes of anger.\n\nAbout a month before my birthday, this took a bizarre turn. Not only did I distrust people, I suspected many of them were only pretending to be my friends. I was convinced they were plotting against me. And I realized something: I deserved it. I was acting like a terrible monster, even if I didn't know exactly why. I would find a friend with whom I'd had a fight, for example, and apologize for calling them a name that they had in fact called me. I was saying I'd done or said things that never happened. But I wasn't entirely sure that I hadn't slapped a man with whom I'd had an argument about WikiLeaks. (I hadn't, people were there, they saw an absence of slapping.) But if I hadn't, how could I know that any of my other memories were valid? The real and the imaginary were starting to feel the same. I was sending people rambling Gchats talking about what a bad person I was, and if the conversation topic shifted, I couldn't keep up. I seemed to be talking mostly to myself.\n\nWhen my friend came over to my house, the night before I went in, she hadn't seen me in a month. I hadn't bathed in weeks. I was dressed in a mismatched, nonsensical collection of clothes I'd picked up off the floor. I had lost about 20 pounds; bones were sticking out of my face and wrists. (I had stopped eating.) People told me I couldn't make eye contact. I also couldn't speak above a whisper or in a complete sentence. I had been up for at least 24 hours, and I couldn't sleep. I would lie down, then start back up again to wander around the apartment. My friend stayed up all night watching this, and in the morning she took me to the psych ward of a New York hospital that accepted walk-ins. Nurses took my blood pressure and asked us both a few questions about my behavior and thoughts. A doctor took my friend into a different room and asked her to describe what she'd seen of my behavior. Once they'd talked to her, they handed her my bag and my coat, and told her to leave. They told me I would be staying.\n\nI'm describing this because I want you to see how it sneaked up on me. Mental illness is like this. It doesn't always show up suddenly and dramatically. I had been diagnosed in the past with depression and generalized anxiety disorder, both of which were common illnesses, and which I thought explained my problems. I would have been insulted if you'd suggested I had anything more serious. I was just joyless, I was just angry, I was just lonely. I thought maybe I had chronic fatigue or something, but I didn't see a reason to get it checked out. By the time I was unwashed, incoherent, and skeletal, I had gotten so used to being unhappy that I almost didn't see the difference. (Note: if you start to feel bad for long periods of time, if your thought patterns or personality start to change in odd ways, go to a doctor. It could be a bad mood. It could also be something much more dangerous.)\n\nWhat the doctors at the hospital finally decided was that I had bipolar II disorder, which is a scary diagnosis. It has a high suicide rate and"}

I will show you 3 must-have wheel cleaning tools and what I personally believe is the best wheel cleaner on the market. With these 4 items, your wheels will be easier to clean and they will stay looking better without killing yourself or destroying your knuckles.\n\nHere are some AMAZON links to the tools of choice found in this article:\n\nWheel barrel tools\n\nDeep dish brush\n\nBoar's hair brush\n\nSonax Wheel Cleaner Plus\n\nAll wheel cleaners have their own blend and have different directions. Make sure to always follow the direction as noted on the bottle.\n\nWe begin by applying the Sonax Wheel Cleaner Plus to a cool wheel. Be sure to coat the face and the barrel with the cleaner.\n\nShortly after applying the cleaner, it will begin to turn a deep purple color. The product is now breaking down ferrous materials\u2026not just removing them.\n\nAllow the cleaner to dwell for 3-5 minutes per the directions(including your clean time).\n\nDraw out your wheel barrel tool and go to town on the inner barrel. The long reach will allow you to easily clean the deeper recesses. Be sure to sway the tool behind the spokes as well!\n\nThen move to your deep dish brush. It has a flexible stem that can be bent to reach behind spokes and around the hub mount of the wheel. It can also be used on the barrel when the wheel barrel tool is too thick to fit between surfaces.\n\nIf you have run out of time at this point, rinse the wheels and reapply for further cleaning. If you still have time on the clock, move forward with the cleaner that has already been applied.\n\nThe boar's hair brush is great for getting into nooks and crannies on wheels and caliper faces(sides and rear can be used with the tools noted above). Wheel lug recesses can be a pain but with a boar's hair brush you should not have any problems.\n\nFinally, rinse those bad boys off! If you missed spots or the filth was extra heavy, additional treatments may be needed. You should be left with a beautiful wheel when it is all said and done!!\n\nAnd for when you must have the best of the best, get a Modesta wheel coating applied to your wheels! It will make ongoing care even easier and your wheels will be better protected for years to come.\n\nHere's an example of a set of wheels that we protected with a coating years ago.

To those who have wondered just how those little K-cup thingys work and especially to those who have not heard of this new fangled technology at all (you must be living under a rock if you fall in that category!). Keurig brewers are specially designed to extract coffee from a K-cup. A K-cup is a highly engineered, technologically sophisticated mini coffee brewer inside of a very tiny body. K-cups consist of four parts:\n\nThe outer plastic casing. This is a special designed housing that blocks out moisture, light and air allowing your precious coffee to remain perfectly fresh until you are ready to brew it.\n\nA permeable paper filter. The paper filter allows for optimal flavor extraction.\n\nA foil seal. The foil seal keep the coffee air tight and blocks out oxygen and humidity.\n\nK-cups contain a perfectly measured amount of coffee creating a consistent brew cup after cup.\n\nTo brew coffee with a Keurig, the first step is to place the K-cup in the brew chamber of the unit. When the handle is pulled down closing the chamber, a small needle will puncture the foil lid of the K-cup penetrating the coffee with pressurized water at high temperature.The coffee is filtered through the paper. At the same time a second needle punctures the bottom of the K-cup, allowing freshly brewed coffee to pour into your mug.\n\nThis video does a nice job of demonstrating the brewing process:\n\nKeurig K-cup technology is incredibly revolutionary yet incredibly simple at the same time. The creators of the Keurig system shrunk coffee brewing down to its smallest form- one cup at a time. The K-cup is really just a tiny little drip style coffee brewer. The concept is exactly the same however, the technology of the Keurig itself is far more sophisticated.\n\nMany have tried to duplicate this technology but few have come close to matching the quality. So many consumers choose to brew their own coffee grinds with special adapters. Although they seem like a cost saver up front, we have yet to find one that operates as easily and tastes as good as a genuine Kcup.\n\nIf you are reading this article you may also be interested in:"}
